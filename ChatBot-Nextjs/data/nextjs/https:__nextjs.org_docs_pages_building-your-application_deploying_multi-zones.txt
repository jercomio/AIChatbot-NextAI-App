Multi ZonesExamples
With Zones

A zone is a single deployment of a Next.js app. You can have multiple zones and merge them as a single app.
For example, let's say you have the following apps:

An app for serving /blog/**
Another app for serving all other pages

With multi zones support, you can merge both these apps into a single one allowing your customers to browse it using a single URL, but you can develop and deploy both apps independently.
How to define a zone
  
    
    
  

There are no zone related APIs. You only need to do the following:

Make sure to keep only the pages you need in your app, meaning that an app can't have pages from another app, if app A has /blog then app B shouldn't have it too.
Make sure to configure a basePath to avoid conflicts with pages and static files.

How to merge zones
  
    
    
  

You can merge zones using rewrites in one of the apps or any HTTP proxy.
For Next.js on Vercel applications, you can use a monorepo to deploy both apps with a single git push.
