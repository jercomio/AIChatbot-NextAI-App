logging
You can configure the logging level and whether the full URL is logged to the console when running Next.js in development mode.
Currently, logging only applies to data fetching using the fetch API. It does not yet apply to other logs inside of Next.js.
next.config.jsmodule.exports = {
  logging: {
    fetches: {
      fullUrl: true,
    },
  },
}
