Partial Prerendering (experimental)
Warning: Partial Prerendering is an experimental feature and is currently not suitable for production environments.

Partial Prerendering is an experimental feature that allows static portions of a route to be prerendered and served from the cache with dynamic holes streamed in, all in a single HTTP request.
Partial Prerendering is available in next@canary:
Terminalnpm install next@canary
You can enable Partial Prerendering by setting the experimental ppr flag:
next.config.js/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: true,
  },
}
 
module.exports = nextConfig

Good to know:

Partial Prerendering does not yet apply to client-side navigations. We are actively working on this.
Partial Prerendering is designed for the Node.js runtime only. Using the subset of the Node.js runtime is not needed when you can instantly serve the static shell.
