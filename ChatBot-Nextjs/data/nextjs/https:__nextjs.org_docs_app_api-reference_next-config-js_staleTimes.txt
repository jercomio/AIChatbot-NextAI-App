StaleTimes (experimental)
Warning: The staleTimes configuration is an experimental feature. This configuration strategy will likely change in the future.

staleTimes is an experimental feature that allows configuring the invalidation period of the client router cache.
This configuration option is available as of v14.2.0-canary.53.
You can enable this experimental feature & provide custom revalidation times by setting the experimental staleTimes flag:
next.config.js/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    staleTimes: {
      dynamic: 30,
      static: 180,
    },
  },
}
 
module.exports = nextConfig
The static and dynamic properties correspond with the time period (in seconds) based on different types of link prefetching.

The dynamic property is used when the prefetch prop on Link is left unspecified.

Default: 30 seconds


The static property is used when the prefetch prop on Link is set to true, or when calling router.prefetch.

Default: 5 minutes




Good to know:

Loading boundaries are considered reusable for the static period defined in this configuration.
This doesn't disable partial rendering support, meaning shared layouts won't automatically be refetched every navigation, only the new segment data.
This doesn't change back/forward caching behavior to prevent layout shift & to prevent losing the browser scroll position.
The different properties of this config refer to variable levels of "liveness" and are unrelated to whether the segment itself is opting into static or dynamic rendering. In other words, the current static default of 5 minutes suggests that data feels static by virtue of it being revalidated infrequently.
