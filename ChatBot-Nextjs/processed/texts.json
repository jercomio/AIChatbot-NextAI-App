Therefore, if you need to use the same font in multiple places, you should load it in one place and import the related font object where you need it. This is done using a font definitions file.\nFor example, create a fonts.ts file in a styles folder at the root of your app directory.\nThen, specify your font definitions as follows:\nstyles/fonts.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Inter, Lora, Source_Sans_3 } from 'next/font/google'\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n \n// define your variable fonts\nconst inter = Inter()\nconst lora = Lora()\n// define 2 weights of a non-variable font\nconst sourceCodePro400 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '400' })\nconst sourceCodePro700 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '700' })\n// define a custom local font where GreatVibes-Regular.ttf is stored in the styles folder\nconst greatVibes = localFont({ src: './GreatVibes-Regular.ttf' })\n \nexport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro400, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes }\n\nYou can now use these definitions in your code as follows:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes } from '../styles/fonts'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p className={inter.className}>Hello world using Inter font</p>\n      <p style={lora.style}>Hello world using Lora font</p>\n      <p className={sourceCodePro700.className}>\n        Hello world using Source_Sans_3 font with weight 700\n      </p>\n      <p className={greatVibes.className}>My title in Great Vibes font</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nTo make it easier to access the font definitions in your code, you can define a path alias in your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json files as follows:\ntsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/fonts\": [\"./styles/fonts\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\nYou can now import any font definition as follows:\napp/about/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { greatVibes, sourceCodePro400 } from '@/fonts'\n\nVersion Changes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.2.0@next/font renamed to next/font. Installation no longer required.v13.0.0@next/font was added."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_api-reference_components_image.txt","text":"<Image>\nExamples\nImage Component\n\n\nThis API reference will help you understand how to use props and configuration options available for the Image Component.

This can be either an absolute external URL, or an internal path depending on the loader prop.\n\nWhen using an external URL, you must add it to remotePatterns in next.config.js.\nwidth\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe width property represents the rendered width in pixels, so it will affect how large the image appears.\nRequired, except for statically imported images or images with the fill property.\nheight\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe height property represents the rendered height in pixels, so it will affect how large the image appears.\nRequired, except for statically imported images or images with the fill property.\nalt\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe alt property is used to describe the image for screen readers and search engines. It is also the fallback text if images have been disabled or an error occurs while loading the image.\nIt should contain text that could replace the image without changing the meaning of the page. It is not meant to supplement the image and should not repeat information that is already provided in the captions above or below the image.\nIf the image is purely decorative or not intended for the user, the alt property should be an empty string (alt=\"\").\nLearn more\nOptional Props\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe <Image /> component accepts a number of additional properties beyond those which are required. This section describes the most commonly-used properties of the Image component. Find details about more rarely-used properties in the Advanced Props section.\nloader\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA custom function used to resolve image URLs.\nA loader is a function returning a URL string for the image, given the following parameters:\n\nsrc\nwidth\nquality\n\nHere is an example of using a custom loader:\n'use client'\n \nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nconst imageLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      loader={imageLoader}\n      src=\"me.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\nGood to know: Using props like loader, which accept a function, requires using Client Components to serialize the provided function.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use the loaderFile configuration in next.config.js to configure every instance of next/image in your application, without passing a prop.\nfill\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nfill={true} // {true} | {false}\nA boolean that causes the image to fill the parent element, which is useful when the width and height are unknown.\nThe parent element must assign position: \"relative\", position: \"fixed\", or position: \"absolute\" style.\nBy default, the img element will automatically be assigned the position: \"absolute\" style.\nIf no styles are applied to the image, the image will stretch to fit the container. You may prefer to set object-fit: \"contain\" for an image which is letterboxed to fit the container and preserve aspect ratio.\nAlternatively, object-fit: \"cover\" will cause the image to fill the entire container and be cropped to preserve aspect ratio. For this to look correct, the overflow: \"hidden\" style should be assigned to the parent element.\nFor more information, see also:\n\nposition\nobject-fit\nobject-position\n\nsizes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA string, similar to a media query, that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. The value of sizes will greatly affect performance for images using fill or which are styled to have a responsive size.\nThe sizes property serves two important purposes related to image performance:\n\nFirst, the value of sizes is used by the browser to determine which size of the image to download, from next/image's automatically generated srcset. When the browser chooses, it does not yet know the size of the image on the page, so it selects an image that is the same size or larger than the viewport. The sizes property allows you to tell the browser that the image will actually be smaller than full screen. If you don't specify a sizes value in an image with the fill property, a default value of 100vw (full screen width) is used.\nSecond, the sizes property changes the behavior of the automatically generated srcset value. If no sizes value is present, a small srcset is generated, suitable for a fixed-size image (1x/2x/etc). If sizes is defined, a large srcset is generated, suitable for a responsive image (640w/750w/etc). If the sizes property includes sizes such as 50vw, which represent a percentage of the viewport width, then the srcset is trimmed to not include any values which are too small to ever be necessary.\n\nFor example, if you know your styling will cause an image to be full-width on mobile devices, in a 2-column layout on tablets, and a 3-column layout on desktop displays, you should include a sizes property such as the following:\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"grid-element\">\n      <Image\n        fill\n        src=\"/example.png\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nThis example sizes could have a dramatic effect on performance metrics. Without the 33vw sizes, the image selected from the server would be 3 times as wide as it needs to be. Because file size is proportional to the square of the width, without sizes the user would download an image that's 9 times larger than necessary.\nLearn more about srcset and sizes:\n\nweb.dev\nmdn\n\nquality\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nquality={75} // {number 1-100}\nThe quality of the optimized image, an integer between 1 and 100, where 100 is the best quality and therefore largest file size. Defaults to 75.\npriority\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\npriority={false} // {false} | {true}\nWhen true, the image will be considered high priority and\npreload. Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using priority.\nYou should use the priority property on any image detected as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element. It may be appropriate to have multiple priority images, as different images may be the LCP element for different viewport sizes.\nShould only be used when the image is visible above the fold. Defaults to false.\nplaceholder\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nplaceholder = 'empty' // \"empty\" | \"blur\" | \"data:image/...\"\nA placeholder to use while the image is loading. Possible values are blur, empty, or data:image/.... Defaults to empty.\nWhen blur, the blurDataURL property will be used as the placeholder. If src is an object from a static import and the imported image is .jpg, .png, .webp, or .avif, then blurDataURL will be automatically populated, except when the image is detected to be animated.\nFor dynamic images, you must provide the blurDataURL property. Solutions such as Plaiceholder can help with base64 generation.\nWhen data:image/..., the Data URL will be used as the placeholder while the image is loading.\nWhen empty, there will be no placeholder while the image is loading, only empty space.\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the blur placeholder\nDemo the shimmer effect with data URL placeholder prop\nDemo the color effect with blurDataURL prop\n\nAdvanced Props\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn some cases, you may need more advanced usage. The <Image /> component optionally accepts the following advanced properties.\nstyle\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAllows passing CSS styles to the underlying image element.\ncomponents/ProfileImage.jsconst imageStyle = {\n  borderRadius: '50%',\n  border: '1px solid #fff',\n}\n \nexport default function ProfileImage() {\n  return <Image src=\"...\" style={imageStyle} />\n}\nRemember that the required width and height props can interact with your styling. If you use styling to modify an image's width, you should also style its height to auto to preserve its intrinsic aspect ratio, or your image will be distorted.\nonLoadingComplete\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n'use client'\n \n<Image onLoadingComplete={(img) => console.log(img.naturalWidth)} />\n\n\nWarning: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of onLoad.\n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the placeholder has been removed.\nThe callback function will be called with one argument, a reference to the underlying <img> element.\n\nGood to know: Using props like onLoadingComplete, which accept a function, requires using Client Components to serialize the provided function.\n\nonLoad\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n<Image onLoad={(e) => console.log(e.target.naturalWidth)} />\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the placeholder has been removed.\nThe callback function will be called with one argument, the Event which has a target that references the underlying <img> element.\n\nGood to know: Using props like onLoad, which accept a function, requires using Client Components to serialize the provided function.\n\nonError\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n<Image onError={(e) => console.error(e.target.id)} />\nA callback function that is invoked if the image fails to load.\n\nGood to know: Using props like onError, which accept a function, requires using Client Components to serialize the provided function.\n\nloading\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nRecommendation: This property is only meant for advanced use cases. Switching an image to load with eager will normally hurt performance. We recommend using the priority property instead, which will eagerly preload the image.\n\nloading = 'lazy' // {lazy} | {eager}\nThe loading behavior of the image. Defaults to lazy.\nWhen lazy, defer loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from\nthe viewport.\nWhen eager, load the image immediately.\nLearn more about the loading attribute.\nblurDataURL\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA Data URL to\nbe used as a placeholder image before the src image successfully loads. Only takes effect when combined\nwith placeholder=\"blur\".\nMust be a base64-encoded image. It will be enlarged and blurred, so a very small image (10px or\nless) is recommended. Including larger images as placeholders may harm your application performance.\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the default blurDataURL prop\nDemo the color effect with blurDataURL prop\n\nYou can also generate a solid color Data URL to match the image.\nunoptimized\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nunoptimized = {false} // {false} | {true}\nWhen true, the source image will be served as-is instead of changing quality,\nsize, or format. Defaults to false.\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nconst UnoptimizedImage = (props) => {\n  return <Image {...props} unoptimized />\n}\nSince Next.js 12.3.0, this prop can be assigned to all images by updating next.config.js with the following configuration:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    unoptimized: true,\n  },\n}\noverrideSrc\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen providing the src prop to the <Image> component, both the srcset and src attributes are generated automatically for the resulting <img>.\ninput.js<Image src=\"/me.jpg\" />\noutput.html<img\n  srcset=\"\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=640&q=75 1x,\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75 2x\n  \"\n  src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75\"\n/>\nIn some cases, it is not desirable to have the src attribute generated and you may wish to override it using the overrideSrc prop.\nFor example, when upgrading an existing website from <img> to <Image>, you may wish to maintain the same src attribute for SEO purposes such as image ranking or avoiding recrawl.\ninput.js<Image src=\"/me.jpg\" overrideSrc=\"/override.jpg\" />\noutput.html<img\n  srcset=\"\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=640&q=75 1x,\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75 2x\n  \"\n  src=\"/override.jpg\"\n/>\nOther Props\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOther properties on the <Image /> component will be passed to the underlying\nimg element with the exception of the following:\n\nsrcSet. Use Device Sizes instead.\ndecoding. It is always \"async\".\n\nConfiguration Options\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn addition to props, you can configure the Image Component in next.config.js. The following options are available:\nremotePatterns\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo protect your application from malicious users, configuration is required in order to use external images. This ensures that only external images from your account can be served from the Next.js Image Optimization API. These external images can be configured with the remotePatterns property in your next.config.js file, as shown below:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'example.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/account123/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: The example above will ensure the src property of next/image must start with https://example.com/account123/. Any other protocol, hostname, port, or unmatched path will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nBelow is another example of the remotePatterns property in the next.config.js file:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: '**.example.com',\n        port: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: The example above will ensure the src property of next/image must start with https://img1.example.com or https://me.avatar.example.com or any number of subdomains. Any other protocol, port, or unmatched hostname will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nWildcard patterns can be used for both pathname and hostname and have the following syntax:\n\n* match a single path segment or subdomain\n** match any number of path segments at the end or subdomains at the beginning\n\nThe ** syntax does not work in the middle of the pattern.\n\nGood to know: When omitting protocol, port or pathname, then the wildcard ** is implied. This is not recommended because it may allow malicious actors to optimize urls you did not intend.\n\ndomains\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWarning: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of strict remotePatterns in order to protect your application from malicious users. Only use domains if you own all the content served from the domain.\n\nSimilar to remotePatterns, the domains configuration can be used to provide a list of allowed hostnames for external images.\nHowever, the domains configuration does not support wildcard pattern matching and it cannot restrict protocol, port, or pathname.\nBelow is an example of the domains property in the next.config.js file:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    domains: ['assets.acme.com'],\n  },\n}\nloaderFile\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using the Next.js built-in Image Optimization API, you can configure the loaderFile in your next.config.js like the following:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'custom',\n    loaderFile: './my/image/loader.js',\n  },\n}\nThis must point to a file relative to the root of your Next.js application. The file must export a default function that returns a string, for example:\nmy/image/loader.js'use client'\n \nexport default function myImageLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n\nAlternatively, you can use the loader prop to configure each instance of next/image.\nExamples:\n\nCustom Image Loader Configuration\n\n\nGood to know: Customizing the image loader file, which accepts a function, requires using Client Components to serialize the provided function.\n\nAdvanced\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following configuration is for advanced use cases and is usually not necessary. If you choose to configure the properties below, you will override any changes to the Next.js defaults in future updates.\ndeviceSizes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you know the expected device widths of your users, you can specify a list of device width breakpoints using the deviceSizes property in next.config.js. These widths are used when the next/image component uses sizes prop to ensure the correct image is served for user's device.\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],\n  },\n}\nimageSizes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can specify a list of image widths using the images.imageSizes property in your next.config.js file. These widths are concatenated with the array of device sizes to form the full array of sizes used to generate image srcsets.\nThe reason there are two separate lists is that imageSizes is only used for images which provide a sizes prop, which indicates that the image is less than the full width of the screen. Therefore, the sizes in imageSizes should all be smaller than the smallest size in deviceSizes.\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],\n  },\n}\nformats\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default Image Optimization API will automatically detect the browser's supported image formats via the request's Accept header.\nIf the Accept head matches more than one of the configured formats, the first match in the array is used. Therefore, the array order matters. If there is no match (or the source image is animated), the Image Optimization API will fallback to the original image's format.\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/webp'],\n  },\n}\nYou can enable AVIF support with the following configuration.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nAVIF generally takes 20% longer to encode but it compresses 20% smaller compared to WebP. This means that the first time an image is requested, it will typically be slower and then subsequent requests that are cached will be faster.\nIf you self-host with a Proxy/CDN in front of Next.js, you must configure the Proxy to forward the Accept header.\n\n\nCaching Behavior\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following describes the caching algorithm for the default loader. For all other loaders, please refer to your cloud provider's documentation.\nImages are optimized dynamically upon request and stored in the <distDir>/cache/images directory. The optimized image file will be served for subsequent requests until the expiration is reached. When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the expired image is served stale immediately. Then the image is optimized again in the background (also called revalidation) and saved to the cache with the new expiration date.\nThe cache status of an image can be determined by reading the value of the x-nextjs-cache response header. The possible values are the following:\n\nMISS - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\nSTALE - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\nHIT - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by either the minimumCacheTTL configuration or the upstream image Cache-Control header, whichever is larger. Specifically, the max-age value of the Cache-Control header is used. If both s-maxage and max-age are found, then s-maxage is preferred. The max-age is also passed-through to any downstream clients including CDNs and browsers.\n\nYou can configure minimumCacheTTL to increase the cache duration when the upstream image does not include Cache-Control header or the value is very low.\nYou can configure deviceSizes and imageSizes to reduce the total number of possible generated images.\nYou can configure formats to disable multiple formats in favor of a single image format.\n\nminimumCacheTTL\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can configure the Time to Live (TTL) in seconds for cached optimized images. In many cases, it's better to use a Static Image Import which will automatically hash the file contents and cache the image forever with a Cache-Control header of immutable.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    minimumCacheTTL: 60,\n  },\n}\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) of the optimized image is defined by either the minimumCacheTTL or the upstream image Cache-Control header, whichever is larger.\nIf you need to change the caching behavior per image, you can configure headers to set the Cache-Control header on the upstream image (e.g. /some-asset.jpg, not /_next/image itself).\nThere is no mechanism to invalidate the cache at this time, so its best to keep minimumCacheTTL low. Otherwise you may need to manually change the src prop or delete <distDir>/cache/images.\ndisableStaticImages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default behavior allows you to import static files such as import icon from './icon.png' and then pass that to the src property.\nIn some cases, you may wish to disable this feature if it conflicts with other plugins that expect the import to behave differently.\nYou can disable static image imports inside your next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\ndangerouslyAllowSVG\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default loader does not optimize SVG images for a few reasons. First, SVG is a vector format meaning it can be resized losslessly. Second, SVG has many of the same features as HTML/CSS, which can lead to vulnerabilities without proper Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.\nTherefore, we recommended using the unoptimized prop when the src prop is known to be SVG. This happens automatically when src ends with \".svg\".\nHowever, if you need to serve SVG images with the default Image Optimization API, you can set dangerouslyAllowSVG inside your next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,\n    contentDispositionType: 'attachment',\n    contentSecurityPolicy: \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;\",\n  },\n}\nIn addition, it is strongly recommended to also set contentDispositionType to force the browser to download the image, as well as contentSecurityPolicy to prevent scripts embedded in the image from executing.\nAnimated Images\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default loader will automatically bypass Image Optimization for animated images and serve the image as-is.\nAuto-detection for animated files is best-effort and supports GIF, APNG, and WebP. If you want to explicitly bypass Image Optimization for a given animated image, use the unoptimized prop.\nResponsive Images\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default generated srcset contains 1x and 2x images in order to support different device pixel ratios. However, you may wish to render a responsive image that stretches with the viewport. In that case, you'll need to set sizes as well as style (or className).\nYou can render a responsive image using one of the following methods below.\nResponsive image using a static import\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf the source image is not dynamic, you can statically import to create a responsive image:\ncomponents/author.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport me from '../photos/me.jpg'\n \nexport default function Author() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={me}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        width: '100%',\n        height: 'auto',\n      }}\n    />\n  )\n}\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the image responsive to viewport\n\nResponsive image with aspect ratio\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf the source image is a dynamic or a remote url, you will also need to provide width and height to set the correct aspect ratio of the responsive image:\ncomponents/page.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page({ photoUrl }) {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={photoUrl}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        width: '100%',\n        height: 'auto',\n      }}\n      width={500}\n      height={300}\n    />\n  )\n}\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the image responsive to viewport\n\nResponsive image with fill\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you don't know the aspect ratio, you will need to set the fill prop and set position: relative on the parent. Optionally, you can set object-fit style depending on the desired stretch vs crop behavior:\napp/page.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page({ photoUrl }) {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '300px', height: '500px' }}>\n      <Image\n        src={photoUrl}\n        alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n        sizes=\"300px\"\n        fill\n        style={{\n          objectFit: 'contain',\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the fill prop\n\nTheme Detection CSS\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to display a different image for light and dark mode, you can create a new component that wraps two <Image> components and reveals the correct one based on a CSS media query.\ncomponents/theme-image.module.css.imgDark {\n  display: none;\n}\n \n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  .imgLight {\n    display: none;\n  }\n  .imgDark {\n    display: unset;\n  }\n}\ncomponents/theme-image.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport styles from './theme-image.module.css'\nimport Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \ntype Props = Omit<ImageProps, 'src' | 'priority' | 'loading'> & {\n  srcLight: string\n  srcDark: string\n}\n \nconst ThemeImage = (props: Props) => {\n  const { srcLight, srcDark, ...rest } = props\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcLight} className={styles.imgLight} />\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcDark} className={styles.imgDark} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know: The default behavior of loading=\"lazy\" ensures that only the correct image is loaded. You cannot use priority or loading=\"eager\" because that would cause both images to load. Instead, you can use fetchPriority=\"high\".\n\nTry it out:\n\nDemo light/dark mode theme detection\n\ngetImageProps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor more advanced use cases, you can call getImageProps() to get the props that would be passed to the underlying <img> element, and instead pass to them to another component, style, canvas, etc.\nThis also avoid calling React useState() so it can lead to better performance, but it cannot be used with the placeholder prop because the placeholder will never be removed.\nTheme Detection Picture\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to display a different image for light and dark mode, you can use the <picture> element to display a different image based on the user's preferred color scheme.\napp/page.jsimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const common = { alt: 'Theme Example', width: 800, height: 400 }\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: dark },\n  } = getImageProps({ ...common, src: '/dark.png' })\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: light, ...rest },\n  } = getImageProps({ ...common, src: '/light.png' })\n \n  return (\n    <picture>\n      <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcSet={dark} />\n      <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcSet={light} />\n      <img {...rest} />\n    </picture>\n  )\n}\nArt Direction\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to display a different image for mobile and desktop, sometimes called Art Direction, you can provide different src, width, height, and quality props to getImageProps().\napp/page.jsimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  const common = { alt: 'Art Direction Example', sizes: '100vw' }\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: desktop },\n  } = getImageProps({\n    ...common,\n    width: 1440,\n    height: 875,\n    quality: 80,\n    src: '/desktop.jpg',\n  })\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: mobile, ...rest },\n  } = getImageProps({\n    ...common,\n    width: 750,\n    height: 1334,\n    quality: 70,\n    src: '/mobile.jpg',\n  })\n \n  return (\n    <picture>\n      <source media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\" srcSet={desktop} />\n      <source media=\"(min-width: 500px)\" srcSet={mobile} />\n      <img {...rest} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />\n    </picture>\n  )\n}\nBackground CSS\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can even convert the srcSet string to the image-set() CSS function to optimize a background image.\napp/page.jsimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nfunction getBackgroundImage(srcSet = '') {\n  const imageSet = srcSet\n    .split(', ')\n    .map((str) => {\n      const [url, dpi] = str.split(' ')\n      return `url(\"${url}\") ${dpi}`\n    })\n    .join(', ')\n  return `image-set(${imageSet})`\n}\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet },\n  } = getImageProps({ alt: '', width: 128, height: 128, src: '/img.png' })\n  const backgroundImage = getBackgroundImage(srcSet)\n  const style = { height: '100vh', width: '100vw', backgroundImage }\n \n  return (\n    <main style={style}>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\nKnown Browser Bugs\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis next/image component uses browser native lazy loading, which may fallback to eager loading for older browsers before Safari 15.4. When using the blur-up placeholder, older browsers before Safari 12 will fallback to empty placeholder. When using styles with width/height of auto, it is possible to cause Layout Shift on older browsers before Safari 15 that don't preserve the aspect ratio. For more details, see this MDN video.\n\nSafari 15 - 16.3 display a gray border while loading. Safari 16.4 fixed this issue. Possible solutions:\n\nUse CSS @supports (font: -apple-system-body) and (-webkit-appearance: none) { img[loading=\"lazy\"] { clip-path: inset(0.6px) } }\nUse priority if the image is above the fold\n\n\nFirefox 67+ displays a white background while loading.

Next.js prefetches and loads the linked route (denoted by the href) and its data in the background to improve the performance of client-side navigations. Prefetching is only enabled in production.\nnull (default): Prefetch behavior depends on whether the route is static or dynamic. For static routes, the full route will be prefetched (including all its data).

This is necessary if you’re using libraries like styled-components. Without this, the <a> tag will not have the href attribute, which hurts your site's accessibility and might affect SEO. If you're using ESLint, there is a built-in rule next/link-passhref to ensure correct usage of passHref.\n\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\n \n// This creates a custom component that wraps an <a> tag\nconst RedLink = styled.a`\n  color: red;\n`\n \nfunction NavLink({ href, name }) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={href} passHref legacyBehavior>\n      <RedLink>{name}</RedLink>\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default NavLink\n\nIf you’re using emotion’s JSX pragma feature (@jsx jsx), you must use passHref even if you use an <a> tag directly.\nThe component should support onClick property to trigger navigation correctly\n\nIf the child is a functional component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf the child of Link is a functional component, in addition to using passHref and legacyBehavior, you must wrap the component in React.forwardRef:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \n// `onClick`, `href`, and `ref` need to be passed to the DOM element\n// for proper handling\nconst MyButton = React.forwardRef(({ onClick, href }, ref) => {\n  return (\n    <a href={href} onClick={onClick} ref={ref}>\n      Click Me\n    </a>\n  )\n})\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/about\" passHref legacyBehavior>\n      <MyButton />\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Home\nWith URL Object\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nLink can also receive a URL object and it will automatically format it to create the URL string. Here's how to do it:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <Link\n          href={{\n            pathname: '/about',\n            query: { name: 'test' },\n          }}\n        >\n          About us\n        </Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link\n          href={{\n            pathname: '/blog/[slug]',\n            query: { slug: 'my-post' },\n          }}\n        >\n          Blog Post\n        </Link>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Home\nThe above example has a link to:\n\nA predefined route: /about?name=test\nA dynamic route: /blog/my-post\n\nYou can use every property as defined in the Node.js URL module documentation.\nReplace the URL instead of push\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default behavior of the Link component is to push a new URL into the history stack. You can use the replace prop to prevent adding a new entry, as in the following example:\n<Link href=\"/about\" replace>\n  About us\n</Link>\nDisable scrolling to the top of the page\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default behavior of Link is to scroll to the top of the page. When there is a hash defined it will scroll to the specific id, like a normal <a> tag. To prevent scrolling to the top / hash scroll={false} can be added to Link:\n<Link href=\"/#hashid\" scroll={false}>\n  Disables scrolling to the top\n</Link>\nMiddleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIt's common to use Middleware for authentication or other purposes that involve rewriting the user to a different page. In order for the <Link /> component to properly prefetch links with rewrites via Middleware, you need to tell Next.js both the URL to display and the URL to prefetch. This is required to avoid un-necessary fetches to middleware to know the correct route to prefetch.\nFor example, if you want to serve a /dashboard route that has authenticated and visitor views, you may add something similar to the following in your Middleware to redirect the user to the correct page:\nmiddleware.jsexport function middleware(req) {\n  const nextUrl = req.nextUrl\n  if (nextUrl.pathname === '/dashboard') {\n    if (req.cookies.authToken) {\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/auth/dashboard', req.url))\n    } else {\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/public/dashboard', req.url))\n    }\n  }\n}\nIn this case, you would want to use the following code in your <Link /> component:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport useIsAuthed from './hooks/useIsAuthed'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const isAuthed = useIsAuthed()\n  const path = isAuthed ? '/auth/dashboard' : '/public/dashboard'\n  return (\n    <Link as=\"/dashboard\" href={path}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.0.0No longer requires a child <a> tag.

There are four different strategies that can be used:\n\nbeforeInteractive: Load before any Next.js code and before any page hydration occurs.\nafterInteractive: (default) Load early but after some hydration on the page occurs.\nlazyOnload: Load during browser idle time.\nworker: (experimental) Load in a web worker.\n\nbeforeInteractive\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nScripts that load with the beforeInteractive strategy are injected into the initial HTML from the server, downloaded before any Next.js module, and executed in the order they are placed before any hydration occurs on the page.\nScripts denoted with this strategy are preloaded and fetched before any first-party code, but their execution does not block page hydration from occurring.\nbeforeInteractive scripts must be placed inside the root layout (app/layout.tsx) and are designed to load scripts that are needed by the entire site (i.e. the script will load when any page in the application has been loaded server-side).\n\nThis strategy should only be used for critical scripts that need to be fetched before any part of the page becomes interactive.\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Script\n          src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n          strategy=\"beforeInteractive\"\n        />\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know: Scripts with beforeInteractive will always be injected inside the head of the HTML document regardless of where it's placed in the component.\n\nSome examples of scripts that should be loaded as soon as possible with beforeInteractive include:\n\nBot detectors\nCookie consent managers\n\nafterInteractive\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nScripts that use the afterInteractive strategy are injected into the HTML client-side and will load after some (or all) hydration occurs on the page. This is the default strategy of the Script component and should be used for any script that needs to load as soon as possible but not before any first-party Next.js code.\nafterInteractive scripts can be placed inside of any page or layout and will only load and execute when that page (or group of pages) is opened in the browser.\napp/page.jsimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"afterInteractive\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\nSome examples of scripts that are good candidates for afterInteractive include:\n\nTag managers\nAnalytics\n\nlazyOnload\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nScripts that use the lazyOnload strategy are injected into the HTML client-side during browser idle time and will load after all resources on the page have been fetched. This strategy should be used for any background or low priority scripts that do not need to load early.\nlazyOnload scripts can be placed inside of any page or layout and will only load and execute when that page (or group of pages) is opened in the browser.\napp/page.jsimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"lazyOnload\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\nExamples of scripts that do not need to load immediately and can be fetched with lazyOnload include:\n\nChat support plugins\nSocial media widgets\n\nworker\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWarning: The worker strategy is not yet stable and does not yet work with the app directory. Use with caution.\n\nScripts that use the worker strategy are off-loaded to a web worker in order to free up the main thread and ensure that only critical, first-party resources are processed on it. While this strategy can be used for any script, it is an advanced use case that is not guaranteed to support all third-party scripts.\nTo use worker as a strategy, the nextScriptWorkers flag must be enabled in next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    nextScriptWorkers: true,\n  },\n}\nworker scripts can only currently be used in the pages/ directory:\npages/home.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"worker\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nonLoad\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWarning: onLoad does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components. Further, onLoad can't be used with beforeInteractive – consider using onReady instead.\n\nSome third-party scripts require users to run JavaScript code once after the script has finished loading in order to instantiate content or call a function. If you are loading a script with either afterInteractive or lazyOnload as a loading strategy, you can execute code after it has loaded using the onLoad property.\nHere's an example of executing a lodash method only after the library has been loaded.\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.20/lodash.min.js\"\n        onLoad={() => {\n          console.log(_.sample([1, 2, 3, 4]))\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nonReady\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWarning: onReady does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components.\n\nSome third-party scripts require users to run JavaScript code after the script has finished loading and every time the component is mounted (after a route navigation for example). You can execute code after the script's load event when it first loads and then after every subsequent component re-mount using the onReady property.\nHere's an example of how to re-instantiate a Google Maps JS embed every time the component is mounted:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useRef } from 'react'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const mapRef = useRef()\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <div ref={mapRef}></div>\n      <Script\n        id=\"google-maps\"\n        src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js\"\n        onReady={() => {\n          new google.maps.Map(mapRef.current, {\n            center: { lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644 },\n            zoom: 8,\n          })\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nonError\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWarning: onError does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components. onError cannot be used with the beforeInteractive loading strategy.\n\nSometimes it is helpful to catch when a script fails to load. These errors can be handled with the onError property:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        onError={(e: Error) => {\n          console.error('Script failed to load', e)\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.0.0beforeInteractive and afterInteractive is modified to support app.v12.2.4onReady prop added.v12.2.2Allow next/script with beforeInteractive to be placed in _document.v11.0.0next/script introduced."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_api-reference_create-next-app.txt","text":"create-next-app\nThe easiest way to get started with Next.js is by using create-next-app. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you.\nYou can create a new app using the default Next.js template, or by using one of the official Next.js examples.\nInteractive\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can create a new project interactively by running:\nTerminalnpx create-next-app@latest\nTerminalyarn create next-app\nTerminalpnpm create next-app\nTerminalbunx create-next-app\nYou will then be asked the following prompts:\nTerminalWhat is your project named?  my-app\nWould you like to use TypeScript?

This is because a shared layout is not re-rendered during navigation which could lead to stale searchParams between navigations.\nWhen using client-side navigation, Next.js automatically only renders the part of the page below the common layout between two routes.\nFor example, in the following directory structure, dashboard/layout.tsx is the common layout for both /dashboard/settings and /dashboard/analytics:\n\nWhen navigating from /dashboard/settings to /dashboard/analytics, page.tsx in /dashboard/analytics will rerender on the server, while dashboard/layout.tsx will not rerender because it's a common UI shared between the two routes.\nThis performance optimization allows navigation between pages that share a layout to be quicker as only the data fetching and rendering for the page has to run, instead of the entire route that could include shared layouts that fetch their own data.\nBecause dashboard/layout.tsx doesn't re-render, the searchParams prop in the layout Server Component might become stale after navigation.\n\nInstead, use the Page searchParams prop or the useSearchParams hook in a Client Component, which is re-rendered on the client with the latest searchParams.\n\nRoot Layouts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nThe app directory must include a root app/layout.js.\nThe root layout must define <html> and <body> tags.\n\nYou should not manually add <head> tags such as <title> and <meta> to root layouts. Instead, you should use the Metadata API which automatically handles advanced requirements such as streaming and de-duplicating <head> elements.\n\n\nYou can use route groups to create multiple root layouts.\n\nNavigating across multiple root layouts will cause a full page load (as opposed to a client-side navigation). For example, navigating from /cart that uses app/(shop)/layout.js to /blog that uses app/(marketing)/layout.js will cause a full page load. This only applies to multiple root layouts.\n\n\n\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.0.0layout introduced."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_api-reference_file-conventions_loading.txt","text":"loading.jsA loading file can create instant loading states built on Suspense.\nBy default, this file is a Server Component - but can also be used as a Client Component through the \"use client\" directive.\napp/feed/loading.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Loading() {\n  // Or a custom loading skeleton component\n  return <p>Loading...</p>\n}\n\nLoading UI components do not accept any parameters.\n\nGood to know\n\nWhile designing loading UI, you may find it helpful to use the React Developer Tools to manually toggle Suspense boundaries.\n\n\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.0.0loading introduced."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_api-reference_file-conventions_metadata.txt","text":"Metadata Files API ReferenceThis section of the docs covers Metadata file conventions.

For example, /product/sitemap/1.xml.\nIn development, you can view the generated sitemap on /.../sitemap.xml/[id]. For example, /product/sitemap.xml/1. This difference is temporary and will follow the production format.\nSee the generateSitemaps API reference for more information.\nReturns\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default function exported from sitemap.(xml|ts|js) should return an array of objects with the following properties:\ntype Sitemap = Array<{\n  url: string\n  lastModified?: string | Date\n  changeFrequency?:\n    | 'always'\n    | 'hourly'\n    | 'daily'\n    | 'weekly'\n    | 'monthly'\n    | 'yearly'\n    | 'never'\n  priority?: number\n  alternates?: {\n    languages?: Languages<string>\n  }\n}>\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.4.5Add changeFrequency and priority attributes to sitemaps.v13.3.0sitemap introduced."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_api-reference_file-conventions_middleware.txt","text":"middleware.jsThe middleware.js|ts file is used to write Middleware and run code on the server before a request is completed.

It's particularly useful for implementing custom server-side logic like authentication, logging, or handling redirects.\nUse the file middleware.ts (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware.

This object includes the matcher to specify paths where the Middleware applies.\nMatcher\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe matcher option allows you to target specific paths for the Middleware to run on. You can specify these paths in several ways:\n\nFor a single path: Directly use a string to define the path, like '/about'.\nFor multiple paths: Use an array to list multiple paths, such as matcher: ['/about', '/contact'], which applies the Middleware to both /about and /contact.\n\nAdditionally, matcher supports complex path specifications through regular expressions, such as matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)'], enabling precise control over which paths to include or exclude.\nThe matcher option also accepts an array of objects with the following keys:\n\nsource: The path or pattern used to match the request paths. It can be a string for direct path matching or a pattern for more complex matching.\nregexp (optional): A regular expression string that fine-tunes the matching based on the source. It provides additional control over which paths are included or excluded.\nlocale (optional): A boolean that, when set to false, ignores locale-based routing in path matching.\nhas (optional): Specifies conditions based on the presence of specific request elements such as headers, query parameters, or cookies.\nmissing (optional): Focuses on conditions where certain request elements are absent, like missing headers or cookies.\n\nmiddleware.jsexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    {\n      source: '/api/*',\n      regexp: '^/api/(.*)',\n      locale: false,\n      has: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'Authorization', value: 'Bearer Token' },\n        { type: 'query', key: 'userId', value: '123' },\n      ],\n      missing: [{ type: 'cookie', key: 'session', value: 'active' }],\n    },\n  ],\n}\nParams\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nrequest\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen defining Middleware, the default export function accepts a single parameter, request.

Semantically equivalent to revalidate: Infinity which effectively means the resource should be cached indefinitely. It is still possible for individual fetch requests to use cache: 'no-store' or revalidate: 0 to avoid being cached and make the route dynamically rendered. Or set revalidate to a positive number lower than the route default to increase the revalidation frequency of a route.\n0: Ensure a layout or page is always dynamically rendered even if no dynamic functions or uncached data fetches are discovered.

This forces all fetch requests to be re-fetched every request even if they provide a 'force-cache' option.\nCross-route segment behavior\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAny options set across each layout and page of a single route need to be compatible with each other.\n\nIf both the 'only-cache' and 'force-cache' are provided, then 'force-cache' wins. If both 'only-no-store' and 'force-no-store' are provided, then 'force-no-store' wins. The force option changes the behavior across the route so a single segment with 'force-*' would prevent any errors caused by 'only-*'.\nThe intention of the 'only-*' and force-*' options is to guarantee the whole route is either fully static or fully dynamic. This means:\n\nA combination of 'only-cache' and 'only-no-store' in a single route is not allowed.\nA combination of 'force-cache' and 'force-no-store' in a single route is not allowed.\n\n\nA parent cannot provide 'default-no-store' if a child provides 'auto' or '*-cache' since that could make the same fetch have different behavior.\n\n\nIt is generally recommended to leave shared parent layouts as 'auto' and customize the options where child segments diverge.\n\nruntime\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nlayout.tsx | page.tsx | route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport const runtime = 'nodejs'\n// 'nodejs' | 'edge'\n\n\n'nodejs' (default)\n'edge'\n\nLearn more about the Edge and Node.js runtimes.\npreferredRegion\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nlayout.tsx | page.tsx | route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport const preferredRegion = 'auto'\n// 'auto' | 'global' | 'home' | ['iad1', 'sfo1']\n\nSupport for preferredRegion, and regions supported, is dependent on your deployment platform.\n\nGood to know:\n\nIf a preferredRegion is not specified, it will inherit the option of the nearest parent layout.\nThe root layout defaults to all regions.\n\n\nmaxDuration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, Next.js does not limit the execution of server-side logic (rendering a page or handling an API).\nDeployment platforms can use maxDuration from the Next.js build output to add specific execution limits.\nFor example, on Vercel.\nNote: This settings requires Next.js 13.4.10 or higher.\nlayout.tsx | page.tsx | route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport const maxDuration = 5\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nIf using Server Actions, set the maxDuration at the page level to change the default timeout of all Server Actions used on the page.\n\n\ngenerateStaticParams\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe generateStaticParams function can be used in combination with dynamic route segments to define the list of route segment parameters that will be statically generated at build time instead of on-demand at request time.\nSee the API reference for more details."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_api-reference_file-conventions_route.txt","text":"route.jsRoute Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web Request and Response APIs.\nHTTP Methods\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA route file allows you to create custom request handlers for a given route.

This allows configuring a URL for local development, staging, and production environments.\n\nURL Composition\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nURL composition favors developer intent over default directory traversal semantics.\n\nTrailing slashes between metadataBase and metadata fields are normalized.\nAn \"absolute\" path in a metadata field (that typically would replace the whole URL path) is treated as a \"relative\" path (starting from the end of metadataBase).\n\nFor example, given the following metadataBase:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  metadataBase: new URL('https://acme.com'),\n}\n\nAny metadata fields that inherit the above metadataBase and set their own value will be resolved as follows:\nmetadata fieldResolved URL/https://acme.com./https://acme.compaymentshttps://acme.com/payments/paymentshttps://acme.com/payments./paymentshttps://acme.com/payments../paymentshttps://acme.com/paymentshttps://beta.acme.com/paymentshttps://beta.acme.com/payments\nopenGraph\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nlayout.js | page.jsexport const metadata = {\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Next.js',\n    description: 'The React Framework for the Web',\n    url: 'https://nextjs.org',\n    siteName: 'Next.js',\n    images: [\n      {\n        url: 'https://nextjs.org/og.png', // Must be an absolute URL\n        width: 800,\n        height: 600,\n      },\n      {\n        url: 'https://nextjs.org/og-alt.png', // Must be an absolute URL\n        width: 1800,\n        height: 1600,\n        alt: 'My custom alt',\n      },\n    ],\n    locale: 'en_US',\n    type: 'website',\n  },\n}\n<head> output<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Next.js\" />\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The React Framework for the Web\" />\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https://nextjs.org/\" />\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Next.js\" />\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:url\" content=\"https://nextjs.org/og.png\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"800\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"600\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:url\" content=\"https://nextjs.org/og-alt.png\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"1800\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"1600\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:alt\" content=\"My custom alt\" />\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"website\" />\nlayout.js | page.jsexport const metadata = {\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Next.js',\n    description: 'The React Framework for the Web',\n    type: 'article',\n    publishedTime: '2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z',\n    authors: ['Seb', 'Josh'],\n  },\n}\n<head> output<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Next.js\" />\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The React Framework for the Web\" />\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" />\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\" />\n<meta property=\"article:author\" content=\"Seb\" />\n<meta property=\"article:author\" content=\"Josh\" />\n\nGood to know:\n\nIt may be more convenient to use the file-based Metadata API for Open Graph images.

While traditionally a 302 was used for a temporary redirect, and a 301 for a permanent redirect, many browsers changed the request method of the redirect, from a POST to GET request when using a 302, regardless of the origins request method.\nTaking the following example of a redirect from /users to /people, if you make a POST request to /users to create a new user, and are conforming to a 302 temporary redirect, the request method will be changed from a POST to a GET request. This doesn't make sense, as to create a new user, you should be making a POST request to /people, and not a GET request.\nThe introduction of the 307 status code means that the request method is preserved as POST.\n\n302 - Temporary redirect, will change the request method from POST to GET\n307 - Temporary redirect, will preserve the request method as POST\n\nThe redirect() method uses a 307 by default, instead of a 302 temporary redirect, meaning your requests will always be preserved as POST requests.\nLearn more about HTTP Redirects.\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.0.0redirect introduced."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_api-reference_functions_revalidatePath.txt","text":"revalidatePathrevalidatePath allows you to purge cached data on-demand for a specific path.\n\nGood to know:\n\nrevalidatePath is available in both Node.js and Edge runtimes.\nrevalidatePath only invalidates the cache when the included path is next visited.

The client will merge the updated React Server Component payload without losing unaffected client-side React (e.g. useState) or browser state (e.g. scroll position).\nrouter.prefetch(href: string): Prefetch the provided route for faster client-side transitions.\nrouter.back(): Navigate back to the previous route in the browser’s history stack.\nrouter.forward(): Navigate forwards to the next page in the browser’s history stack.\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe <Link> component automatically prefetch routes as they become visible in the viewport.\nrefresh() could re-produce the same result if fetch requests are cached.

This will allow any Client Components above it to be statically rendered and sent as part of initial HTML. Example.\nFor example:\napp/dashboard/search-bar.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function SearchBar() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  const search = searchParams.get('search')\n \n  // This will not be logged on the server when using static rendering\n  console.log(search)\n \n  return <>Search: {search}</>\n}\n\napp/dashboard/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport SearchBar from './search-bar'\n \n// This component passed as a fallback to the Suspense boundary\n// will be rendered in place of the search bar in the initial HTML.\n// When the value is available during React hydration the fallback\n// will be replaced with the `<SearchBar>` component.\nfunction SearchBarFallback() {\n  return <>placeholder</>\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Suspense fallback={<SearchBarFallback />}>\n          <SearchBar />\n        </Suspense>\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nBehavior\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDynamic Rendering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf a route is dynamically rendered, useSearchParams will be available on the server during the initial server render of the Client Component.\nFor example:\napp/dashboard/search-bar.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function SearchBar() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  const search = searchParams.get('search')\n \n  // This will be logged on the server during the initial render\n  // and on the client on subsequent navigations.\n  console.log(search)\n \n  return <>Search: {search}</>\n}\n\napp/dashboard/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport SearchBar from './search-bar'\n \nexport const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <SearchBar />\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know: Setting the dynamic route segment config option to force-dynamic can be used to force dynamic rendering.\n\nServer Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo access search params in Pages (Server Components), use the searchParams prop.\nLayouts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUnlike Pages, Layouts (Server Components) do not receive the searchParams prop. This is because a shared layout is not re-rendered during navigation which could lead to stale searchParams between navigations. View detailed explanation.\nInstead, use the Page searchParams prop or the useSearchParams hook in a Client Component, which is re-rendered on the client with the latest searchParams.\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUpdating searchParams\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use useRouter or Link to set new searchParams.

Previously, when deploying with Docker you would need to have all files from your package's dependencies installed to run next start. Starting with Next.js 12, you can leverage Output File Tracing in the .next/ directory to only include the necessary files.\nFurthermore, this removes the need for the deprecated serverless target which can cause various issues and also creates unnecessary duplication.\nHow it Works\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDuring next build, Next.js will use @vercel/nft to statically analyze import, require, and fs usage to determine all files that a page might load.\nNext.js' production server is also traced for its needed files and output at .next/next-server.js.nft.json which can be leveraged in production.\nTo leverage the .nft.json files emitted to the .next output directory, you can read the list of files in each trace that are relative to the .nft.json file and then copy them to your deployment location.\nAutomatically Copying Traced Files\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can automatically create a standalone folder that copies only the necessary files for a production deployment including select files in node_modules.\nTo leverage this automatic copying you can enable it in your next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  output: 'standalone',\n}\nThis will create a folder at .next/standalone which can then be deployed on its own without installing node_modules.\nAdditionally, a minimal server.js file is also output which can be used instead of next start. This minimal server does not copy the public or .next/static folders by default as these should ideally be handled by a CDN instead, although these folders can be copied to the standalone/public and standalone/.next/static folders manually, after which server.js file will serve these automatically.\n\nGood to know:\n\nIf your project needs to listen to a specific port or hostname, you can define PORT or HOSTNAME environment variables before running server.js. For example, run PORT=8080 HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 node server.js to start the server on http://0.0.0.0:8080.\nIf your project uses Image Optimization with the default loader, you must install sharp as a dependency:\n\n\n\nTerminalnpm i sharp\nTerminalyarn add sharp\nTerminalpnpm add sharp\nTerminalbun add sharp\nCaveats\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWhile tracing in monorepo setups, the project directory is used for tracing by default. For next build packages/web-app, packages/web-app would be the tracing root and any files outside of that folder will not be included. To include files outside of this folder you can set experimental.outputFileTracingRoot in your next.config.js.\n\npackages/web-app/next.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    // this includes files from the monorepo base two directories up\n    outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname, '../../'),\n  },\n}\n\nThere are some cases in which Next.js might fail to include required files, or might incorrectly include unused files. In those cases, you can leverage experimental.outputFileTracingExcludes and experimental.outputFileTracingIncludes respectively in next.config.js. Each config accepts an object with minimatch globs for the key to match specific pages and a value of an array with globs relative to the project's root to either include or exclude in the trace.\n\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    outputFileTracingExcludes: {\n      '/api/hello': ['./un-necessary-folder/**/*'],\n    },\n    outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n      '/api/another': ['./necessary-folder/**/*'],\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nCurrently, Next.js does not do anything with the emitted .nft.json files. The files must be read by your deployment platform, for example Vercel, to create a minimal deployment. In a future release, a new command is planned to utilize these .nft.json files.\n\nExperimental turbotrace\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTracing dependencies can be slow because it requires very complex computations and analysis. We created turbotrace in Rust as a faster and smarter alternative to the JavaScript implementation.\nTo enable it, you can add the following configuration to your next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbotrace: {\n      // control the log level of the turbotrace, default is `error`\n      logLevel?:\n      | 'bug'\n      | 'fatal'\n      | 'error'\n      | 'warning'\n      | 'hint'\n      | 'note'\n      | 'suggestions'\n      | 'info',\n      // control if the log of turbotrace should contain the details of the analysis, default is `false`\n      logDetail?: boolean\n      // show all log messages without limit\n      // turbotrace only show 1 log message for each categories by default\n      logAll?: boolean\n      // control the context directory of the turbotrace\n      // files outside of the context directory will not be traced\n      // set the `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot` has the same effect\n      // if the `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot` and this option are both set, the `experimental.turbotrace.contextDirectory` will be used\n      contextDirectory?: string\n      // if there is `process.cwd()` expression in your code, you can set this option to tell `turbotrace` the value of `process.cwd()` while tracing.\n      // for example the require(process.cwd() + '/package.json') will be traced as require('/path/to/cwd/package.json')\n      processCwd?: string\n      // control the maximum memory usage of the `turbotrace`, in `MB`, default is `6000`.\n      memoryLimit?: number\n    },\n  },\n}"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_api-reference_next-config-js_pageExtensions.txt","text":"pageExtensions\nBy default, Next.js accepts files with the following extensions: .tsx, .ts, .jsx, .js.

Traditionally a 302 was used for a temporary redirect, and a 301 for a permanent redirect, but many browsers changed the request method of the redirect to GET, regardless of the original method. For example, if the browser made a request to POST /v1/users which returned status code 302 with location /v2/users, the subsequent request might be GET /v2/users instead of the expected POST /v2/users. Next.js uses the 307 temporary redirect, and 308 permanent redirect status codes to explicitly preserve the request method used.\n\n\nbasePath: false or undefined - if false the basePath won't be included when matching, can be used for external redirects only.\nlocale: false or undefined - whether the locale should not be included when matching.\nhas is an array of has objects with the type, key and value properties.\nmissing is an array of missing objects with the type, key and value properties.\n\nRedirects are checked before the filesystem which includes pages and /public files.\nWhen using the Pages Router, redirects are not applied to client-side routing (Link, router.push) unless Middleware is present and matches the path.\nWhen a redirect is applied, any query values provided in the request will be passed through to the redirect destination.

Currently, there is enough coverage for some popular loaders, and we'll expand our API support in the future.\nOnly loaders that return JavaScript code are supported. Loaders that transform files like stylesheets or images are not currently supported.\nOptions passed to webpack loaders must be plain JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays.

In other words, import underscore from 'underscore' will load the lodash module instead of underscore.\nTurbopack also supports conditional aliasing through this field, similar to Node.js's conditional exports. At the moment only the browser condition is supported. In the case above, imports of the mocha module will be aliased to mocha/browser-entry.js when Turbopack targets browser environments.\nResolve extensions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThrough next.config.js, Turbopack can be configured to resolve modules with custom extensions, similar to webpack's resolve.extensions configuration.\nTo configure resolve extensions, use the resolveExtensions field in next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      resolveExtensions: [\n        '.mdx',\n        '.tsx',\n        '.ts',\n        '.jsx',\n        '.js',\n        '.mjs',\n        '.json',\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n}\nThis overwrites the original resolve extensions with the provided list.

It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password.\nSession Management tracks the user's state (e.g. logged in) across multiple requests.\nAuthorization decides what parts of the application the user is allowed to access.\n\nThis page demonstrates how to use Next.js features to implement common authentication, authorization, and session management patterns so you can choose the best solutions based on your application's needs.\nAuthentication\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAuthentication verifies a user's identity. This happens when a user logs in, either with a username and password or through a service like Google. It's all about confirming that users are really who they claim to be, protecting both the user's data and the application from unauthorized access or fraudulent activities.\nAuthentication Strategies\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nModern web applications commonly use several authentication strategies:\n\nOAuth/OpenID Connect (OIDC): Enable third-party access without sharing user credentials. Ideal for social media logins and Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions. They add an identity layer with OpenID Connect.\nCredentials-based login (Email + Password): A standard choice for web applications, where users log in with an email and password. Familiar and easy to implement, it requires robust security measures against threats like phishing.\nPasswordless/Token-based authentication: Use email magic links or SMS one-time codes for secure, password-free access. Popular for its convenience and enhanced security, this method helps reduce password fatigue. Its limitation is the dependency on the user's email or phone availability.\nPasskeys/WebAuthn: Use cryptographic credentials unique to each site, offering high security against phishing. Secure but new, this strategy can be difficult to implement.\n\nSelecting an authentication strategy should align with your application's specific requirements, user interface considerations, and security objectives.\nImplementing Authentication\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn this section, we'll explore the process of adding basic email-password authentication to a web application. While this method provides a fundamental level of security, it's worth considering more advanced options like OAuth or passwordless logins for enhanced protection against common security threats. The authentication flow we'll discuss is as follows:\n\n\nThe user submits their credentials through a login form.\nThe form calls a Server Action.\nUpon successful verification, the process is completed, indicating the user's successful authentication.\nIf verification is unsuccessful, an error message is shown.\nConsider a login form where users can input their credentials:app/login/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { authenticate } from '@/app/lib/actions'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <form action={authenticate}>\n      <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" required />\n      <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}The form above has two input fields for capturing the user's email and password. On submission, it calls the authenticate Server Action.You can then call your Authentication Provider's API in the Server Action to handle authentication:app/lib/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nimport { signIn } from '@/auth'\n \nexport async function authenticate(_currentState: unknown, formData: FormData) {\n  try {\n    await signIn('credentials', formData)\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error) {\n      switch (error.type) {\n        case 'CredentialsSignin':\n          return 'Invalid credentials.'\n        default:\n          return 'Something went wrong.'\n      }\n    }\n    throw error\n  }\n}\nIn this code, the signIn method checks the credentials against stored user data.\nAfter the authentication provider processes the credentials, there are two possible outcomes:\n\nSuccessful Authentication: This outcome implies that the login was successful. Further actions, such as accessing protected routes and fetching user information, can then be initiated.\nFailed Authentication: In cases where the credentials are incorrect or an error is encountered, the function returns a corresponding error message to indicate the authentication failure.\n\nFinally, in your login-form.tsx component, you can use React's useFormState to call the Server Action and handle form errors, and use useFormStatus to handle the pending state of the form:app/login/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { authenticate } from '@/app/lib/actions'\nimport { useFormState, useFormStatus } from 'react-dom'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const [errorMessage, dispatch] = useFormState(authenticate, undefined)\n \n  return (\n    <form action={dispatch}>\n      <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" required />\n      <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required />\n      <div>{errorMessage && <p>{errorMessage}</p>}</div>\n      <LoginButton />\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n \nfunction LoginButton() {\n  const { pending } = useFormStatus()\n \n  const handleClick = (event) => {\n    if (pending) {\n      event.preventDefault()\n    }\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <button aria-disabled={pending} type=\"submit\" onClick={handleClick}>\n      Login\n    </button>\n  )\n}\nFor a more streamlined authentication setup in Next.js projects, especially when offering multiple login methods, consider using a comprehensive authentication solution.\nAuthorization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOnce a user is authenticated, you'll need to ensure the user is allowed to visit certain routes, and perform operations such as mutating data with Server Actions and calling Route Handlers.\nProtecting Routes with Middleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware in Next.js helps you control who can access different parts of your website. This is important for keeping areas like the user dashboard protected while having other pages like marketing pages be public. It's recommended to apply Middleware across all routes and specify exclusions for public access.\nHere's how to implement Middleware for authentication in Next.js:\nSetting Up Middleware:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nCreate a middleware.ts or .js file in your project's root directory.\nInclude logic to authorize user access, such as checking for authentication tokens.\n\nDefining Protected Routes:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nNot all routes require authorization. Use the matcher option in your Middleware to specify any routes that do not require authorization checks.\n\nMiddleware Logic:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWrite logic to verify if a user is authenticated. Check user roles or permissions for route authorization.\n\nHandling Unauthorized Access:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nRedirect unauthorized users to a login or error page as appropriate.\n\nExample Middleware file:\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const currentUser = request.cookies.get('currentUser')?.value\n \n  if (currentUser && !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {\n    return Response.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', request.url))\n  }\n \n  if (!currentUser && !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/login')) {\n    return Response.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))\n  }\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)'],\n}\n\nThis example uses Response.redirect for handling redirects early in the request pipeline, making it efficient and centralizing access control.\nFor specific redirection needs, the redirect function can be used in Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions to provide more control. This is useful for role-based navigation or context-sensitive scenarios.app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  // Logic to determine if a redirect is needed\n  const accessDenied = true\n  if (accessDenied) {\n    redirect('/login')\n  }\n \n  // Define other routes and logic\n}\nAfter successful authentication, it's important to manage user navigation based on their roles. For example, an admin user might be redirected to an admin dashboard, while a regular user is sent to a different page. This is important for role-specific experiences and conditional navigation, such as prompting users to complete their profile if needed.\nWhen setting up authorization, it's important to ensure that the main security checks happen where your app accesses or changes data. While Middleware can be useful for initial validation, it should not be the sole line of defense in protecting your data. The bulk of security checks should be performed in the Data Access Layer (DAL).\n\nThis approach, highlighted in this security blog, advocates for consolidating all data access within a dedicated DAL. This strategy ensures consistent data access, minimizes authorization bugs, and simplifies maintenance. To ensure comprehensive security, consider the following key areas:\nServer Actions: Implement security checks in server-side processes, especially for sensitive operations.\nRoute Handlers: Manage incoming requests with security measures to ensure access is limited to authorized users.\nData Access Layer (DAL): Directly interacts with the database and is crucial for validating and authorizing data transactions. It's vital to perform critical checks within the DAL to secure data at its most crucial interaction point—access or modification.\nFor a detailed guide on securing the DAL, including example code snippets and advanced security practices, refer to our Data Access Layer section of the security guide.Protecting Server Actions\n  \n    \n    \n  \nIt is important to treat Server Actions with the same security considerations as public-facing API endpoints. Verifying user authorization for each action is crucial. Implement checks within Server Actions to determine user permissions, such as restricting certain actions to admin users.In the example below, we check the user's role before allowing the action to proceed:app/lib/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \n// ...\n \nexport async function serverAction() {\n  const session = await getSession()\n  const userRole = session?.user?.role\n \n  // Check if user is authorized to perform the action\n  if (userRole !== 'admin') {\n    throw new Error('Unauthorized access: User does not have admin privileges.')\n  }\n \n  // Proceed with the action for authorized users\n  // ... implementation of the action\n}Protecting Route Handlers\n  \n    \n    \n  \nRoute Handlers in Next.js play a vital role in managing incoming requests. Just like Server Actions, they should be secured to ensure that only authorized users can access certain functionalities. This often involves verifying the user's authentication status and their permissions.Here's an example of securing a Route Handler:app/api/route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport async function GET() {\n  // User authentication and role verification\n  const session = await getSession()\n \n  // Check if the user is authenticated\n  if (!session) {\n    return new Response(null, { status: 401 }) // User is not authenticated\n  }\n \n  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n  if (session.user.role !== 'admin') {\n    return new Response(null, { status: 403 }) // User is authenticated but does not have the right permissions\n  }\n \n  // Data fetching for authorized users\n}This example demonstrates a Route Handler with a two-tier security check for authentication and authorization. It first checks for an active session, and then verifies if the logged-in user is an 'admin'. This approach ensures secure access, limited to authenticated and authorized users, maintaining robust security for request processing.Authorization Using Server Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \nServer Components in Next.js are designed for server-side execution and offer a secure environment for integrating complex logic like authorization. They enable direct access to back-end resources, optimizing performance for data-heavy tasks and enhancing security for sensitive operations.In Server Components, a common practice is to conditionally render UI elements based on the user's role. This approach enhances user experience and security by ensuring users only access content they are authorized to view.Example:app/dashboard/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const session = await getSession()\n  const userRole = session?.user?.role // Assuming 'role' is part of the session object\n \n  if (userRole === 'admin') {\n    return <AdminDashboard /> // Component for admin users\n  } else if (userRole === 'user') {\n    return <UserDashboard /> // Component for regular users\n  } else {\n    return <AccessDenied /> // Component shown for unauthorized access\n  }\n}In this example, the Dashboard component renders different UIs for 'admin', 'user', and unauthorized roles. This pattern ensures that each user interacts only with components appropriate to their role, enhancing both security and user experience.\nBest Practices\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nSecure Session Management: Prioritize the security of session data to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Use encryption and secure storage practices.\nDynamic Role Management: Use a flexible system for user roles to easily adjust to changes in permissions and roles, avoiding hardcoded roles.\nSecurity-First Approach: In all aspects of authorization logic, prioritize security to safeguard user data and maintain the integrity of your application. This includes thorough testing and considering potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nSession Management\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSession management involves tracking and managing a user's interaction with the application over time, ensuring that their authenticated state is preserved across different parts of the application.\nThis prevents the need for repeated logins, enhancing both security and user convenience. There are two primary methods used for session management: cookie-based and database sessions.\nCookie-Based Sessions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n🎥 Watch: Learn more about cookie-based sessions and authentication with Next.js → YouTube (11 minutes).\n\nCookie-based sessions manage user data by storing encrypted session information directly in browser cookies. Upon user login, this encrypted data is stored in the cookie. Each subsequent server request includes this cookie, minimizing the need for repeated server queries and enhancing client-side efficiency.\nHowever, this method requires careful encryption to protect sensitive data, as cookies are susceptible to client-side security risks. Encrypting session data in cookies is key to safeguarding user information from unauthorized access. It ensures that even if a cookie is stolen, the data inside remains unreadable.\nAdditionally, while individual cookies are limited in size (typically around 4KB), techniques like cookie-chunking can overcome this limitation by dividing large session data into multiple cookies.\nSetting a cookie in a Next.js project might look something like this:\nSetting a cookie on the server:\n\napp/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport async function handleLogin(sessionData) {\n  const encryptedSessionData = encrypt(sessionData) // Encrypt your session data\n  cookies().set('session', encryptedSessionData, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',\n    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // One week\n    path: '/',\n  })\n  // Redirect or handle the response after setting the cookie\n}Accessing the session data stored in the cookie in a server component:app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport async function getSessionData(req) {\n  const encryptedSessionData = cookies().get('session')?.value\n  return encryptedSessionData ? JSON.parse(decrypt(encryptedSessionData)) : null\n}\nDatabase Sessions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDatabase session management involves storing session data on the server, with the user's browser only receiving a session ID. This ID references the session data stored server-side, without containing the data itself. This method enhances security, as it keeps sensitive session data away from the client-side environment, reducing the risk of exposure to client-side attacks. Database sessions are also more scalable, accommodating larger data storage needs.\nHowever, this approach has its tradeoffs. It can increase performance overhead due to the need for database lookups at each user interaction. Strategies like session data caching can help mitigate this. Additionally, reliance on the database means that session management is as reliable as the database's performance and availability.\nHere's a simplified example of implementing database sessions in a Next.js application:\nCreating a Session on the Server:\n\nimport db from './lib/db'\n \nexport async function createSession(user) {\n  const sessionId = generateSessionId() // Generate a unique session ID\n  await db.insertSession({ sessionId, userId: user.id, createdAt: new Date() })\n  return sessionId\n}Retrieving a Session in Middleware or Server-Side Logic:import { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport db from './lib/db'\n \nexport async function getSession() {\n  const sessionId = cookies().get('sessionId')?.value\n  return sessionId ? await db.findSession(sessionId) : null\n}\nSelecting Session Management in Next.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDeciding between cookie-based and database sessions in Next.js depends on your application's needs. Cookie-based sessions are simpler and suit smaller applications with lower server load but may offer less security. Database sessions, while more complex, provide better security and scalability, ideal for larger, data-sensitive applications.\nWith authentication solutions such as NextAuth.js, session management becomes more efficient, using either cookies or database storage. This automation simplifies the development process, but it's important to understand the session management method used by your chosen solution. Ensure it aligns with your application's security and performance requirements.\nRegardless of your choice, prioritize security in your session management strategy. For cookie-based sessions, using secure and HTTP-only cookies is crucial to protect session data. For database sessions, regular backups and secure handling of session data are essential. Implementing session expiry and cleanup mechanisms is vital in both approaches to prevent unauthorized access and maintain application performance and reliability.\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nHere are authentication solutions compatible with Next.js, please refer to the quickstart guides below to learn how to configure them in your Next.js application:\n\n\nAuth0\nClerk\nKinde\nLucia\nNextAuth.js\nSupabase\nStytch\nIron Session\n\nFurther Reading\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo continue learning about authentication and security, check out the following resources:\n\nUnderstanding XSS Attacks\nUnderstanding CSRF Attacks\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_caching.txt","text":"Caching in Next.jsNext.js improves your application's performance and reduces costs by caching rendering work and data requests. This page provides an in-depth look at Next.js caching mechanisms, the APIs you can use to configure them, and how they interact with each other.\n\nGood to know: This page helps you understand how Next.js works under the hood but is not essential knowledge to be productive with Next.js. Most of Next.js' caching heuristics are determined by your API usage and have defaults for the best performance with zero or minimal configuration.\n\nOverview\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nHere's a high-level overview of the different caching mechanisms and their purpose:\nMechanismWhatWherePurposeDurationRequest MemoizationReturn values of functionsServerRe-use data in a React Component treePer-request lifecycleData CacheDataServerStore data across user requests and deploymentsPersistent (can be revalidated)Full Route CacheHTML and RSC payloadServerReduce rendering cost and improve performancePersistent (can be revalidated)Router CacheRSC PayloadClientReduce server requests on navigationUser session or time-based\nBy default, Next.js will cache as much as possible to improve performance and reduce cost. This means routes are statically rendered and data requests are cached unless you opt out. The diagram below shows the default caching behavior: when a route is statically rendered at build time and when a static route is first visited.\n\nCaching behavior changes depending on whether the route is statically or dynamically rendered, data is cached or uncached, and whether a request is part of an initial visit or a subsequent navigation. Depending on your use case, you can configure the caching behavior for individual routes and data requests.\nRequest Memoization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nReact extends the fetch API to automatically memoize requests that have the same URL and options. This means you can call a fetch function for the same data in multiple places in a React component tree while only executing it once.\n\nFor example, if you need to use the same data across a route (e.g. in a Layout, Page, and multiple components), you do not have to fetch data at the top of the tree, and forward props between components. Instead, you can fetch data in the components that need it without worrying about the performance implications of making multiple requests across the network for the same data.\napp/example.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptasync function getItem() {\n  // The `fetch` function is automatically memoized and the result\n  // is cached\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../item/1')\n  return res.json()\n}\n \n// This function is called twice, but only executed the first time\nconst item = await getItem() // cache MISS\n \n// The second call could be anywhere in your route\nconst item = await getItem() // cache HIT\n\nHow Request Memoization Works\n\n\nWhile rendering a route, the first time a particular request is called, its result will not be in memory and it'll be a cache MISS.\nTherefore, the function will be executed, and the data will be fetched from the external source, and the result will be stored in memory.\nSubsequent function calls of the request in the same render pass will be a cache HIT, and the data will be returned from memory without executing the function.\nOnce the route has been rendered and the rendering pass is complete, memory is \"reset\" and all request memoization entries are cleared.\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nRequest memoization is a React feature, not a Next.js feature. It's included here to show how it interacts with the other caching mechanisms.\nMemoization only applies to the GET method in fetch requests.\nMemoization only applies to the React Component tree, this means:\n\nIt applies to fetch requests in generateMetadata, generateStaticParams, Layouts, Pages, and other Server Components.\nIt doesn't apply to fetch requests in Route Handlers as they are not a part of the React component tree.\n\n\nFor cases where fetch is not suitable (e.g. some database clients, CMS clients, or GraphQL clients), you can use the React cache function to memoize functions.\n\n\nDuration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe cache lasts the lifetime of a server request until the React component tree has finished rendering.\nRevalidating\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSince the memoization is not shared across server requests and only applies during rendering, there is no need to revalidate it.\nOpting out\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMemoization only applies to the GET method in fetch requests, other methods, such as POST and DELETE, are not memoized. This default behavior is a React optimization and we do not recommend opting out of it.\nTo manage individual requests, you can use the signal property from AbortController. However, this will not opt requests out of memoization, rather, abort in-flight requests.\napp/example.jsconst { signal } = new AbortController()\nfetch(url, { signal })\nData Cache\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has a built-in Data Cache that persists the result of data fetches across incoming server requests and deployments. This is possible because Next.js extends the native fetch API to allow each request on the server to set its own persistent caching semantics.\n\nGood to know: In the browser, the cache option of fetch indicates how a request will interact with the browser's HTTP cache, in Next.js, the cache option indicates how a server-side request will interact with the server's Data Cache.\n\nBy default, data requests that use fetch are cached. You can use the cache and next.revalidate options of fetch to configure the caching behavior.\nHow the Data Cache Works\n\n\nThe first time a fetch request is called during rendering, Next.js checks the Data Cache for a cached response.\nIf a cached response is found, it's returned immediately and memoized.\nIf a cached response is not found, the request is made to the data source, the result is stored in the Data Cache, and memoized.\nFor uncached data (e.g. { cache: 'no-store' }), the result is always fetched from the data source, and memoized.\nWhether the data is cached or uncached, the requests are always memoized to avoid making duplicate requests for the same data during a React render pass.\n\n\nDifferences between the Data Cache and Request Memoization\nWhile both caching mechanisms help improve performance by re-using cached data, the Data Cache is persistent across incoming requests and deployments, whereas memoization only lasts the lifetime of a request.\nWith memoization, we reduce the number of duplicate requests in the same render pass that have to cross the network boundary from the rendering server to the Data Cache server (e.g. a CDN or Edge Network) or data source (e.g. a database or CMS). With the Data Cache, we reduce the number of requests made to our origin data source.\n\nDuration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe Data Cache is persistent across incoming requests and deployments unless you revalidate or opt-out.\nRevalidating\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCached data can be revalidated in two ways, with:\n\nTime-based Revalidation: Revalidate data after a certain amount of time has passed and a new request is made. This is useful for data that changes infrequently and freshness is not as critical.\nOn-demand Revalidation: Revalidate data based on an event (e.g. form submission). On-demand revalidation can use a tag-based or path-based approach to revalidate groups of data at once. This is useful when you want to ensure the latest data is shown as soon as possible (e.g. when content from your headless CMS is updated).\n\nTime-based Revalidation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo revalidate data at a timed interval, you can use the next.revalidate option of fetch to set the cache lifetime of a resource (in seconds).\n// Revalidate at most every hour\nfetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })\nAlternatively, you can use Route Segment Config options to configure all fetch requests in a segment or for cases where you're not able to use fetch.\nHow Time-based Revalidation Works\n\n\nThe first time a fetch request with revalidate is called, the data will be fetched from the external data source and stored in the Data Cache.\nAny requests that are called within the specified timeframe (e.g. 60-seconds) will return the cached data.\nAfter the timeframe, the next request will still return the cached (now stale) data.\n\nNext.js will trigger a revalidation of the data in the background.\nOnce the data is fetched successfully, Next.js will update the Data Cache with the fresh data.\nIf the background revalidation fails, the previous data will be kept unaltered.\n\n\n\nThis is similar to stale-while-revalidate behavior.\nOn-demand Revalidation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nData can be revalidated on-demand by path (revalidatePath) or by cache tag (revalidateTag).\nHow On-Demand Revalidation Works\n\n\nThe first time a fetch request is called, the data will be fetched from the external data source and stored in the Data Cache.\nWhen an on-demand revalidation is triggered, the appropriate cache entries will be purged from the cache.\n\nThis is different from time-based revalidation, which keeps the stale data in the cache until the fresh data is fetched.\n\n\nThe next time a request is made, it will be a cache MISS again, and the data will be fetched from the external data source and stored in the Data Cache.\n\nOpting out\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor individual data fetches, you can opt out of caching by setting the cache option to no-store. This means data will be fetched whenever fetch is called.\n// Opt out of caching for an individual `fetch` request\nfetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\nAlternatively, you can also use the Route Segment Config options to opt out of caching for a specific route segment. This will affect all data requests in the route segment, including third-party libraries.\n// Opt out of caching for all data requests in the route segment\nexport const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'\n\nNote: Data Cache is currently only available in pages/routes, not middleware. Any fetches done inside of your middleware will be uncached by default.\n\n\nVercel Data Cache\nIf your Next.js application is deployed to Vercel, we recommend reading the Vercel Data Cache documentation for a better understanding of Vercel specific features.\n\nFull Route Cache\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nRelated terms:\nYou may see the terms Automatic Static Optimization, Static Site Generation, or Static Rendering being used interchangeably to refer to the process of rendering and caching routes of your application at build time.\n\nNext.js automatically renders and caches routes at build time. This is an optimization that allows you to serve the cached route instead of rendering on the server for every request, resulting in faster page loads.\nTo understand how the Full Route Cache works, it's helpful to look at how React handles rendering, and how Next.js caches the result:\n1. React Rendering on the Server\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOn the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks: by individual routes segments and Suspense boundaries.\nEach chunk is rendered in two steps:\n\nReact renders Server Components into a special data format, optimized for streaming, called the React Server Component Payload.\nNext.js uses the React Server Component Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render HTML on the server.\n\nThis means we don't have to wait for everything to render before caching the work or sending a response. Instead, we can stream a response as work is completed.\n\nWhat is the React Server Component Payload?\nThe React Server Component Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The React Server Component Payload contains:\n\nThe rendered result of Server Components\nPlaceholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files\nAny props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component\n\nTo learn more, see the Server Components documentation.\n\n2. Next.js Caching on the Server (Full Route Cache)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nThe default behavior of Next.js is to cache the rendered result (React Server Component Payload and HTML) of a route on the server. This applies to statically rendered routes at build time, or during revalidation.\n3. React Hydration and Reconciliation on the Client\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAt request time, on the client:\n\nThe HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive initial preview of the Client and Server Components.\nThe React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and rendered Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\nThe JavaScript instructions are used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.\n\n4. Next.js Caching on the Client (Router Cache)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe React Server Component Payload is stored in the client-side Router Cache - a separate in-memory cache, split by individual route segment. This Router Cache is used to improve the navigation experience by storing previously visited routes and prefetching future routes.\n5. Subsequent Navigations\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOn subsequent navigations or during prefetching, Next.js will check if the React Server Components Payload is stored in the Router Cache. If so, it will skip sending a new request to the server.\nIf the route segments are not in the cache, Next.js will fetch the React Server Components Payload from the server, and populate the Router Cache on the client.\nStatic and Dynamic Rendering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhether a route is cached or not at build time depends on whether it's statically or dynamically rendered. Static routes are cached by default, whereas dynamic routes are rendered at request time, and not cached.\nThis diagram shows the difference between statically and dynamically rendered routes, with cached and uncached data:\n\nLearn more about static and dynamic rendering.\nDuration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, the Full Route Cache is persistent. This means that the render output is cached across user requests.\nInvalidation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are two ways you can invalidate the Full Route Cache:\n\nRevalidating Data: Revalidating the Data Cache, will in turn invalidate the Router Cache by re-rendering components on the server and caching the new render output.\nRedeploying: Unlike the Data Cache, which persists across deployments, the Full Route Cache is cleared on new deployments.\n\nOpting out\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can opt out of the Full Route Cache, or in other words, dynamically render components for every incoming request, by:\n\nUsing a Dynamic Function: This will opt the route out from the Full Route Cache and dynamically render it at request time. The Data Cache can still be used.\nUsing the dynamic = 'force-dynamic' or revalidate = 0 route segment config options: This will skip the Full Route Cache and the Data Cache. Meaning components will be rendered and data fetched on every incoming request to the server. The Router Cache will still apply as it's a client-side cache.\nOpting out of the Data Cache: If a route has a fetch request that is not cached, this will opt the route out of the Full Route Cache. The data for the specific fetch request will be fetched for every incoming request. Other fetch requests that do not opt out of caching will still be cached in the Data Cache. This allows for a hybrid of cached and uncached data.\n\nRouter Cache\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nRelated Terms:\nYou may see the Router Cache being referred to as Client-side Cache or Prefetch Cache. While Prefetch Cache refers to the prefetched route segments, Client-side Cache refers to the whole Router cache, which includes both visited and prefetched segments.\nThis cache specifically applies to Next.js and Server Components, and is different to the browser's bfcache, though it has a similar result.\n\nNext.js has an in-memory client-side cache that stores the React Server Component Payload, split by individual route segments, for the duration of a user session. This is called the Router Cache.\nHow the Router Cache Works\n\nAs a user navigates between routes, Next.js caches visited route segments and prefetches the routes the user is likely to navigate to (based on <Link> components in their viewport).\nThis results in an improved navigation experience for the user:\n\nInstant backward/forward navigation because visited routes are cached and fast navigation to new routes because of prefetching and partial rendering.\nNo full-page reload between navigations, and React state and browser state are preserved.\n\n\nDifference between the Router Cache and Full Route Cache:\nThe Router Cache temporarily stores the React Server Component Payload in the browser for the duration of a user session, whereas the Full Route Cache persistently stores the React Server Component Payload and HTML on the server across multiple user requests.\nWhile the Full Route Cache only caches statically rendered routes, the Router Cache applies to both statically and dynamically rendered routes.\n\nDuration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe cache is stored in the browser's temporary memory. Two factors determine how long the router cache lasts:\n\nSession: The cache persists across navigation. However, it's cleared on page refresh.\nAutomatic Invalidation Period: The cache of an individual segment is automatically invalidated after a specific time. The duration depends on how the resource was prefetched:\n\nDefault Prefetching (prefetch={null} or unspecified): 30 seconds\nFull Prefetching: (prefetch={true} or router.prefetch): 5 minutes\n\n\n\nWhile a page refresh will clear all cached segments, the automatic invalidation period only affects the individual segment from the time it was prefetched.\n\nNote: There is experimental support for configuring these values as of v14.2.0-canary.53.\n\nInvalidation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are two ways you can invalidate the Router Cache:\n\nIn a Server Action:\n\nRevalidating data on-demand by path with (revalidatePath) or by cache tag with (revalidateTag)\nUsing cookies.set or cookies.delete invalidates the Router Cache to prevent routes that use cookies from becoming stale (e.g. authentication).\n\n\nCalling router.refresh will invalidate the Router Cache and make a new request to the server for the current route.\n\nOpting out\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIt's not possible to opt out of the Router Cache. However, you can invalidate it by calling router.refresh, revalidatePath, or revalidateTag (see above). This will clear the cache and make a new request to the server, ensuring the latest data is shown.\nYou can also opt out of prefetching by setting the prefetch prop of the <Link> component to false. However, this will still temporarily store the route segments for 30s to allow instant navigation between nested segments, such as tab bars, or back and forward navigation. Visited routes will still be cached.\nCache Interactions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen configuring the different caching mechanisms, it's important to understand how they interact with each other:\nData Cache and Full Route Cache\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nRevalidating or opting out of the Data Cache will invalidate the Full Route Cache, as the render output depends on data.\nInvalidating or opting out of the Full Route Cache does not affect the Data Cache. You can dynamically render a route that has both cached and uncached data. This is useful when most of your page uses cached data, but you have a few components that rely on data that needs to be fetched at request time. You can dynamically render without worrying about the performance impact of re-fetching all the data.\n\nData Cache and Client-side Router cache\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nRevalidating the Data Cache in a Route Handler will not immediately invalidate the Router Cache as the Route Handler isn't tied to a specific route. This means Router Cache will continue to serve the previous payload until a hard refresh, or the automatic invalidation period has elapsed.\nTo immediately invalidate the Data Cache and Router cache, you can use revalidatePath or revalidateTag in a Server Action.\n\nAPIs\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following table provides an overview of how different Next.js APIs affect caching:\nAPIRouter CacheFull Route CacheData CacheReact Cache<Link prefetch>Cacherouter.prefetchCacherouter.refreshRevalidatefetchCacheCachefetch options.cacheCache or Opt outfetch options.next.revalidateRevalidateRevalidatefetch options.next.tagsCacheCacherevalidateTagRevalidate (Server Action)RevalidateRevalidaterevalidatePathRevalidate (Server Action)RevalidateRevalidateconst revalidateRevalidate or Opt outRevalidate or Opt outconst dynamicCache or Opt outCache or Opt outcookiesRevalidate (Server Action)Opt outheaders, searchParamsOpt outgenerateStaticParamsCacheReact.cacheCacheunstable_cache\n<Link>\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, the <Link> component automatically prefetches routes from the Full Route Cache and adds the React Server Component Payload to the Router Cache.\nTo disable prefetching, you can set the prefetch prop to false. But this will not skip the cache permanently, the route segment will still be cached client-side when the user visits the route.\nLearn more about the <Link> component.\nrouter.prefetch\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe prefetch option of the useRouter hook can be used to manually prefetch a route. This adds the React Server Component Payload to the Router Cache.\nSee the useRouter hook API reference.\nrouter.refresh\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe refresh option of the useRouter hook can be used to manually refresh a route. This completely clears the Router Cache, and makes a new request to the server for the current route. refresh does not affect the Data or Full Route Cache.\nThe rendered result will be reconciled on the client while preserving React state and browser state.\nSee the useRouter hook API reference.\nfetch\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nData returned from fetch is automatically cached in the Data Cache.\n// Cached by default. `force-cache` is the default option and can be omitted.\nfetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\nSee the fetch API Reference for more options.\nfetch options.cache\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can opt out individual fetch requests of data caching by setting the cache option to no-store:\n// Opt out of caching\nfetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\nSince the render output depends on data, using cache: 'no-store' will also skip the Full Route Cache for the route where the fetch request is used. That is, the route will be dynamically rendered every request, but you can still have other cached data requests in the same route.\nSee the fetch API Reference for more options.\nfetch options.next.revalidate\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use the next.revalidate option of fetch to set the revalidation period (in seconds) of an individual fetch request. This will revalidate the Data Cache, which in turn will revalidate the Full Route Cache. Fresh data will be fetched, and components will be re-rendered on the server.\n// Revalidate at most after 1 hour\nfetch(`https://...`, { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })\nSee the fetch API reference for more options.\nfetch options.next.tags and revalidateTag\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has a cache tagging system for fine-grained data caching and revalidation.\n\nWhen using fetch or unstable_cache, you have the option to tag cache entries with one or more tags.\nThen, you can call revalidateTag to purge the cache entries associated with that tag.\n\nFor example, you can set a tag when fetching data:\n// Cache data with a tag\nfetch(`https://...`, { next: { tags: ['a', 'b', 'c'] } })\nThen, call revalidateTag with a tag to purge the cache entry:\n// Revalidate entries with a specific tag\nrevalidateTag('a')\nThere are two places you can use revalidateTag, depending on what you're trying to achieve:\n\nRoute Handlers - to revalidate data in response of a third party event (e.g. webhook). This will not invalidate the Router Cache immediately as the Router Handler isn't tied to a specific route.\nServer Actions - to revalidate data after a user action (e.g. form submission). This will invalidate the Router Cache for the associated route.\n\nrevalidatePath\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nrevalidatePath allows you manually revalidate data and re-render the route segments below a specific path in a single operation. Calling the revalidatePath method revalidates the Data Cache, which in turn invalidates the Full Route Cache.\nrevalidatePath('/')\nThere are two places you can use revalidatePath, depending on what you're trying to achieve:\n\nRoute Handlers - to revalidate data in response to a third party event (e.g. webhook).\nServer Actions - to revalidate data after a user interaction (e.g. form submission, clicking a button).\n\nSee the revalidatePath API reference for more information.\n\nrevalidatePath vs. router.refresh:\nCalling router.refresh will clear the Router cache, and re-render route segments on the server without invalidating the Data Cache or the Full Route Cache.\nThe difference is that revalidatePath purges the Data Cache and Full Route Cache, whereas router.refresh() does not change the Data Cache and Full Route Cache, as it is a client-side API.\n\nDynamic Functions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDynamic functions like cookies and headers, and the searchParams prop in Pages depend on runtime incoming request information. Using them will opt a route out of the Full Route Cache, in other words, the route will be dynamically rendered.\ncookies\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUsing cookies.set or cookies.delete in a Server Action invalidates the Router Cache to prevent routes that use cookies from becoming stale (e.g. to reflect authentication changes).\nSee the cookies API reference.\nSegment Config Options\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe Route Segment Config options can be used to override the route segment defaults or when you're not able to use the fetch API (e.g. database client or 3rd party libraries).\nThe following Route Segment Config options will opt out of the Data Cache and Full Route Cache:\n\nconst dynamic = 'force-dynamic'\nconst revalidate = 0\n\nSee the Route Segment Config documentation for more options.\ngenerateStaticParams\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor dynamic segments (e.g. app/blog/[slug]/page.js), paths provided by generateStaticParams are cached in the Full Route Cache at build time. At request time, Next.js will also cache paths that weren't known at build time the first time they're visited.\nYou can disable caching at request time by using export const dynamicParams = false option in a route segment. When this config option is used, only paths provided by generateStaticParams will be served, and other routes will 404 or match (in the case of catch-all routes).\nSee the generateStaticParams API reference.\nReact cache function\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe React cache function allows you to memoize the return value of a function, allowing you to call the same function multiple times while only executing it once.\nSince fetch requests are automatically memoized, you do not need to wrap it in React cache. However, you can use cache to manually memoize data requests for use cases when the fetch API is not suitable. For example, some database clients, CMS clients, or GraphQL clients.\nutils/get-item.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { cache } from 'react'\nimport db from '@/lib/db'\n \nexport const getItem = cache(async (id: string) => {\n  const item = await db.item.findUnique({ id })\n  return item\n})\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_configuring.txt","text":"Configuring\nNext.js allows you to customize your project to meet specific requirements.

It is used in conjunction with CSP to selectively allow certain inline scripts or styles to execute, bypassing strict CSP directives.\nWhy use a nonce?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nEven though CSPs are designed to block malicious scripts, there are legitimate scenarios where inline scripts are necessary. In such cases, nonces offer a way to allow these scripts to execute if they have the correct nonce.\nAdding a nonce with Middleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware enables you to add headers and generate nonces before the page renders.\nEvery time a page is viewed, a fresh nonce should be generated. This means that you must use dynamic rendering to add nonces.\nFor example:\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const nonce = Buffer.from(crypto.randomUUID()).toString('base64')\n  const cspHeader = `\n    default-src 'self';\n    script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic';\n    style-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}';\n    img-src 'self' blob: data:;\n    font-src 'self';\n    object-src 'none';\n    base-uri 'self';\n    form-action 'self';\n    frame-ancestors 'none';\n    upgrade-insecure-requests;\n`\n  // Replace newline characters and spaces\n  const contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue = cspHeader\n    .replace(/\\s{2,}/g, ' ')\n    .trim()\n \n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n  requestHeaders.set('x-nonce', nonce)\n \n  requestHeaders.set(\n    'Content-Security-Policy',\n    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue\n  )\n \n  const response = NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      headers: requestHeaders,\n    },\n  })\n  response.headers.set(\n    'Content-Security-Policy',\n    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue\n  )\n \n  return response\n}\n\nBy default, Middleware runs on all requests.

However, it’s not ideal when you’re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to view the draft immediately on your page. You’d want Next.js to render these pages at request time instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You’d want Next.js to switch to dynamic rendering only for this specific case.\nNext.js has a feature called Draft Mode which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.\nStep 1: Create and access the Route Handler\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFirst, create a Route Handler. It can have any name - e.g. app/api/draft/route.ts\nThen, import draftMode from next/headers and call the enable() method.\napp/api/draft/route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// route handler enabling draft mode\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  draftMode().enable()\n  return new Response('Draft mode is enabled')\n}\n\nThis will set a cookie to enable draft mode. Subsequent requests containing this cookie will trigger Draft Mode changing the behavior for statically generated pages (more on this later).\nYou can test this manually by visiting /api/draft and looking at your browser’s developer tools. Notice the Set-Cookie response header with a cookie named __prerender_bypass.\nSecurely accessing it from your Headless CMS\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn practice, you’d want to call this Route Handler securely from your headless CMS. The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take.\nThese steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting custom draft URLs. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your draft URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the draft URL manually.\nFirst, you should create a secret token string using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing draft URLs.\nSecond, if your headless CMS supports setting custom draft URLs, specify the following as the draft URL. This assumes that your Route Handler is located at app/api/draft/route.ts\nTerminalhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n\n<your-site> should be your deployment domain.\n<token> should be replaced with the secret token you generated.\n<path> should be the path for the page that you want to view. If you want to view /posts/foo, then you should use &slug=/posts/foo.\n\nYour headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the draft URL so that <path> can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: &slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}\nFinally, in the Route Handler:\n\nCheck that the secret matches and that the slug parameter exists (if not, the request should fail).\nCall draftMode.enable() to set the cookie.\nThen redirect the browser to the path specified by slug.\n\napp/api/draft/route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// route handler with secret and slug\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  // Parse query string parameters\n  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)\n  const secret = searchParams.get('secret')\n  const slug = searchParams.get('slug')\n \n  // Check the secret and next parameters\n  // This secret should only be known to this route handler and the CMS\n  if (secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !slug) {\n    return new Response('Invalid token', { status: 401 })\n  }\n \n  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists\n  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS\n  const post = await getPostBySlug(slug)\n \n  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent draft mode from being enabled\n  if (!post) {\n    return new Response('Invalid slug', { status: 401 })\n  }\n \n  // Enable Draft Mode by setting the cookie\n  draftMode().enable()\n \n  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post\n  // We don't redirect to searchParams.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities\n  redirect(post.slug)\n}\n\nIf it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to view with the draft mode cookie.\nStep 2: Update page\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe next step is to update your page to check the value of draftMode().isEnabled.\nIf you request a page which has the cookie set, then data will be fetched at request time (instead of at build time).\nFurthermore, the value of isEnabled will be true.\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// page that fetches data\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\n \nasync function getData() {\n  const { isEnabled } = draftMode()\n \n  const url = isEnabled\n    ? 'https://draft.example.com'\n    : 'https://production.example.com'\n \n  const res = await fetch(url)\n \n  return res.json()\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const { title, desc } = await getData()\n \n  return (\n    <main>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      <p>{desc}</p>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n\nThat's it! If you access the draft Route Handler (with secret and slug) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the draft content. And if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to view the draft.\nSet this as the draft URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the draft.\nTerminalhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\nMore Details\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nClear the Draft Mode cookie\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, the Draft Mode session ends when the browser is closed.\nTo clear the Draft Mode cookie manually, create a Route Handler that calls draftMode().disable():\napp/api/disable-draft/route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  draftMode().disable()\n  return new Response('Draft mode is disabled')\n}\n\nThen, send a request to /api/disable-draft to invoke the Route Handler. If calling this route using next/link, you must pass prefetch={false} to prevent accidentally deleting the cookie on prefetch.\nUnique per next build\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA new bypass cookie value will be generated each time you run next build.\nThis ensures that the bypass cookie can’t be guessed.\n\nGood to know: To test Draft Mode locally over HTTP, your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_configuring_environment-variables.txt","text":"Environment Variables\nExamples\nEnvironment Variables\n\nNext.js comes with built-in support for environment variables, which allows you to do the following:\n\nUse .env.local to load environment variables\nBundle environment variables for the browser by prefixing with NEXT_PUBLIC_\n\nLoading Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has built-in support for loading environment variables from .env.local into process.env.\n.env.localDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_USER=myuser\nDB_PASS=mypassword\n\n\nNote: Next.js also supports multiline variables inside of your .env* files:\n# .env.local\n \n# you can write with line breaks\nPRIVATE_KEY=\"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\nKh9NV...\n...\n-----END DSA PRIVATE KEY-----\"\n \n# or with `\\n` inside double quotes\nPRIVATE_KEY=\"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\\nKh9NV...\\n-----END DSA PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\"\n\nNote: If you are using a /src folder, please note that Next.js will load the .env files only from the parent folder and not from the /src folder.\nThis loads process.env.DB_HOST, process.env.DB_USER, and process.env.DB_PASS into the Node.js environment automatically allowing you to use them in Route Handlers.\nFor example:app/api/route.jsexport async function GET() {\n  const db = await myDB.connect({\n    host: process.env.DB_HOST,\n    username: process.env.DB_USER,\n    password: process.env.DB_PASS,\n  })\n  // ...\n}\nReferencing Other Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js will automatically expand variables that use $ to reference other variables e.g. $VARIABLE inside of your .env* files. This allows you to reference other secrets. For example:\n.envTWITTER_USER=nextjs\nTWITTER_URL=https://twitter.com/$TWITTER_USER\nIn the above example, process.env.TWITTER_URL would be set to https://twitter.com/nextjs.\n\nGood to know: If you need to use variable with a $ in the actual value, it needs to be escaped e.g. \\$.\n\nBundling Environment Variables for the Browser\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNon-NEXT_PUBLIC_ environment variables are only available in the Node.js environment, meaning they aren't accessible to the browser (the client runs in a different environment).\nIn order to make the value of an environment variable accessible in the browser, Next.js can \"inline\" a value, at build time, into the js bundle that is delivered to the client, replacing all references to process.env.[variable] with a hard-coded value. To tell it to do this, you just have to prefix the variable with NEXT_PUBLIC_. For example:\nTerminalNEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=abcdefghijk\nThis will tell Next.js to replace all references to process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID in the Node.js environment with the value from the environment in which you run next build, allowing you to use it anywhere in your code. It will be inlined into any JavaScript sent to the browser.\n\nNote: After being built, your app will no longer respond to changes to these environment variables. For instance, if you use a Heroku pipeline to promote slugs built in one environment to another environment, or if you build and deploy a single Docker image to multiple environments, all NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables will be frozen with the value evaluated at build time, so these values need to be set appropriately when the project is built. If you need access to runtime environment values, you'll have to setup your own API to provide them to the client (either on demand or during initialization).\n\npages/index.jsimport setupAnalyticsService from '../lib/my-analytics-service'\n \n// 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID' can be used here as it's prefixed by 'NEXT_PUBLIC_'.\n// It will be transformed at build time to `setupAnalyticsService('abcdefghijk')`.\nsetupAnalyticsService(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID)\n \nfunction HomePage() {\n  return <h1>Hello World</h1>\n}\n \nexport default HomePage\nNote that dynamic lookups will not be inlined, such as:\n// This will NOT be inlined, because it uses a variable\nconst varName = 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID'\nsetupAnalyticsService(process.env[varName])\n \n// This will NOT be inlined, because it uses a variable\nconst env = process.env\nsetupAnalyticsService(env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID)\nRuntime Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can support both build time and runtime environment variables.\nBy default, environment variables are only available on the server. To expose an environment variable to the browser, it must be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_. However, these public environment variables will be inlined into the JavaScript bundle during next build.\nTo read runtime environment variables, we recommend using getServerSideProps or incrementally adopting the App Router. With the App Router, we can safely read environment variables on the server during dynamic rendering. This allows you to use a singular Docker image that can be promoted through multiple environments with different values.\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default function Component() {\n  noStore()\n  // cookies(), headers(), and other dynamic functions\n  // will also opt into dynamic rendering, meaning\n  // this env variable is evaluated at runtime\n  const value = process.env.MY_VALUE\n  // ...\n}\nGood to know:\n\nYou can run code on server startup using the register function.\nWe do not recommend using the runtimeConfig option, as this does not work with the standalone output mode. Instead, we recommend incrementally adopting the App Router.\n\nDefault Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn general only one .env.local file is needed. However, sometimes you might want to add some defaults for the development (next dev) or production (next start) environment.\nNext.js allows you to set defaults in .env (all environments), .env.development (development environment), and .env.production (production environment).\n.env.local always overrides the defaults set.\n\nGood to know: .env, .env.development, and .env.production files should be included in your repository as they define defaults. .env*.local should be added to .gitignore, as those files are intended to be ignored. .env.local is where secrets can be stored.\n\nEnvironment Variables on Vercel\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen deploying your Next.js application to Vercel, Environment Variables can be configured in the Project Settings.\nAll types of Environment Variables should be configured there. Even Environment Variables used in Development – which can be downloaded onto your local device afterwards.\nIf you've configured Development Environment Variables you can pull them into a .env.local for usage on your local machine using the following command:\nTerminalvercel env pull .env.local\n\nGood to know: When deploying your Next.js application to Vercel, your environment variables in .env* files will not be made available to Edge Runtime, unless their name are prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_. We strongly recommend managing your environment variables in Project Settings instead, from where all environment variables are available.\n\nTest Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nApart from development and production environments, there is a 3rd option available: test. In the same way you can set defaults for development or production environments, you can do the same with a .env.test file for the testing environment (though this one is not as common as the previous two). Next.js will not load environment variables from .env.development or .env.production in the testing environment.\nThis one is useful when running tests with tools like jest or cypress where you need to set specific environment vars only for testing purposes. Test default values will be loaded if NODE_ENV is set to test, though you usually don't need to do this manually as testing tools will address it for you.\nThere is a small difference between test environment, and both development and production that you need to bear in mind: .env.local won't be loaded, as you expect tests to produce the same results for everyone. This way every test execution will use the same env defaults across different executions by ignoring your .env.local (which is intended to override the default set).\n\nGood to know: similar to Default Environment Variables, .env.test file should be included in your repository, but .env.test.local shouldn't, as .env*.local are intended to be ignored through .gitignore.\n\nWhile running unit tests you can make sure to load your environment variables the same way Next.js does by leveraging the loadEnvConfig function from the @next/env package.\n// The below can be used in a Jest global setup file or similar for your testing set-up\nimport { loadEnvConfig } from '@next/env'\n \nexport default async () => {\n  const projectDir = process.cwd()\n  loadEnvConfig(projectDir)\n}\nEnvironment Variable Load Order\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nEnvironment variables are looked up in the following places, in order, stopping once the variable is found.\n\nprocess.env\n.env.$(NODE_ENV).local\n.env.local (Not checked when NODE_ENV is test.)\n.env.$(NODE_ENV)\n.env\n\nFor example, if NODE_ENV is development and you define a variable in both .env.development.local and .env, the value in .env.development.local will be used.\n\nGood to know: The allowed values for NODE_ENV are production, development and test.\n\nGood to know\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nIf you are using a /src directory, .env.* files should remain in the root of your project.\nIf the environment variable NODE_ENV is unassigned, Next.js automatically assigns development when running the next dev command, or production for all other commands.\n\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv9.4.0Support .env and NEXT_PUBLIC_ introduced."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_configuring_eslint.txt","text":"ESLint\nNext.js provides an integrated ESLint experience out of the box.

Refer to the Recommended Plugin Ruleset to learn more.\nCustom Settings\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nrootDir\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you're using eslint-plugin-next in a project where Next.js isn't installed in your root directory (such as a monorepo), you can tell eslint-plugin-next where to find your Next.js application using the settings property in your .eslintrc:\n.eslintrc.json{\n  \"extends\": \"next\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"next\": {\n      \"rootDir\": \"packages/my-app/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nrootDir can be a path (relative or absolute), a glob (i.e. \"packages/*/\"), or an array of paths and/or globs.\nLinting Custom Directories and Files\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, Next.js will run ESLint for all files in the pages/, app/, components/, lib/, and src/ directories. However, you can specify which directories using the dirs option in the eslint config in next.config.js for production builds:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  eslint: {\n    dirs: ['pages', 'utils'], // Only run ESLint on the 'pages' and 'utils' directories during production builds (next build)\n  },\n}\nSimilarly, the --dir and --file flags can be used for next lint to lint specific directories and files:\nTerminalnext lint --dir pages --dir utils --file bar.js\nCaching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo improve performance, information of files processed by ESLint are cached by default. This is stored in .next/cache or in your defined build directory. If you include any ESLint rules that depend on more than the contents of a single source file and need to disable the cache, use the --no-cache flag with next lint.\n\nTerminalnext lint --no-cache\nDisabling Rules\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you would like to modify or disable any rules provided by the supported plugins (react, react-hooks, next), you can directly change them using the rules property in your .eslintrc:\n.eslintrc.json{\n  \"extends\": \"next\",\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"react/no-unescaped-entities\": \"off\",\n    \"@next/next/no-page-custom-font\": \"off\"\n  }\n}\nCore Web Vitals\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe next/core-web-vitals rule set is enabled when next lint is run for the first time and the strict option is selected.\n.eslintrc.json{\n  \"extends\": \"next/core-web-vitals\"\n}\nnext/core-web-vitals updates eslint-plugin-next to error on a number of rules that are warnings by default if they affect Core Web Vitals.\n\nThe next/core-web-vitals entry point is automatically included for new applications built with Create Next App.\n\nUsage With Other Tools\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPrettier\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nESLint also contains code formatting rules, which can conflict with your existing Prettier setup. We recommend including eslint-config-prettier in your ESLint config to make ESLint and Prettier work together.\nFirst, install the dependency:\nTerminalnpm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier\n \nyarn add --dev eslint-config-prettier\n \npnpm add --save-dev eslint-config-prettier\n \nbun add --dev eslint-config-prettier\nThen, add prettier to your existing ESLint config:\n.eslintrc.json{\n  \"extends\": [\"next\", \"prettier\"]\n}\nlint-staged\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you would like to use next lint with lint-staged to run the linter on staged git files, you'll have to add the following to the .lintstagedrc.js file in the root of your project in order to specify usage of the --file flag.\n.lintstagedrc.jsconst path = require('path')\n \nconst buildEslintCommand = (filenames) =>\n  `next lint --fix --file ${filenames\n    .map((f) => path.relative(process.cwd(), f))\n    .join(' --file ')}`\n \nmodule.exports = {\n  '*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}': [buildEslintCommand],\n}\nMigrating Existing Config\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nRecommended Plugin Ruleset\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you already have ESLint configured in your application and any of the following conditions are true:\n\nYou have one or more of the following plugins already installed (either separately or through a different config such as airbnb or react-app):\n\nreact\nreact-hooks\njsx-a11y\nimport\n\n\nYou've defined specific parserOptions that are different from how Babel is configured within Next.js (this is not recommended unless you have customized your Babel configuration)\nYou have eslint-plugin-import installed with Node.js and/or TypeScript resolvers defined to handle imports\n\nThen we recommend either removing these settings if you prefer how these properties have been configured within eslint-config-next or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin instead:\nmodule.exports = {\n  extends: [\n    //...\n    'plugin:@next/next/recommended',\n  ],\n}\nThe plugin can be installed normally in your project without needing to run next lint:\nTerminalnpm install --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n \nyarn add --dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n \npnpm add --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n \nbun add --dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\nThis eliminates the risk of collisions or errors that can occur due to importing the same plugin or parser across multiple configurations.\nAdditional Configurations\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you already use a separate ESLint configuration and want to include eslint-config-next, ensure that it is extended last after other configurations. For example:\n.eslintrc.json{\n  \"extends\": [\"eslint:recommended\", \"next\"]\n}\nThe next configuration already handles setting default values for the parser, plugins and settings properties. There is no need to manually re-declare any of these properties unless you need a different configuration for your use case.\nIf you include any other shareable configurations, you will need to make sure that these properties are not overwritten or modified. Otherwise, we recommend removing any configurations that share behavior with the next configuration or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin as mentioned above."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_configuring_mdx.txt","text":"Markdown and MDX\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It allows you to write using plain text syntax and convert it to structurally valid HTML.

It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity and embed React components within your content.\nNext.js can support both local MDX content inside your application, as well as remote MDX files fetched dynamically on the server. The Next.js plugin handles transforming markdown and React components into HTML, including support for usage in Server Components (the default in App Router).\n@next/mdx\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe @next/mdx package is used to configure Next.js so it can process markdown and MDX. It sources data from local files, allowing you to create pages with a .mdx extension, directly in your /pages or /app directory.\nLet's walk through how to configure and use MDX with Next.js.\nGetting Started\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nInstall packages needed to render MDX:\nTerminalnpm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx\nCreate a mdx-components.tsx file at the root of your application (src/ or the parent folder of app/):\nGood to know: mdx-components.tsx is required to use MDX with App Router and will not work without it.\nmdx-components.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'\n \nexport function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {\n  return {\n    ...components,\n  }\n}\nUpdate the next.config.js file at your project's root to configure it to use MDX:\nnext.config.jsconst withMDX = require('@next/mdx')()\n \n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Configure `pageExtensions` to include MDX files\n  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],\n  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below\n}\n \nmodule.exports = withMDX(nextConfig)\nThen, create a new MDX page within the /app directory:  your-project\n  ├── app\n  │   └── my-mdx-page\n  │       └── page.mdx\n  └── package.json\n\nNow you can use markdown and import React components directly inside your MDX page:\nimport { MyComponent } from 'my-components'\n \n# Welcome to my MDX page!\n \nThis is some **bold** and _italics_ text.\n \nThis is a list in markdown:\n \n- One\n- Two\n- Three\n \nCheckout my React component:\n \n<MyComponent />\nNavigating to the /my-mdx-page route should display your rendered MDX.\nRemote MDX\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf your markdown or MDX files or content lives somewhere else, you can fetch it dynamically on the server. This is useful for content stored in a separate local folder, CMS, database, or anywhere else. A popular community package for this use is next-mdx-remote.\n\nGood to know: Please proceed with caution. MDX compiles to JavaScript and is executed on the server. You should only fetch MDX content from a trusted source, otherwise this can lead to remote code execution (RCE).\n\nThe following example uses next-mdx-remote:\napp/my-mdx-page-remote/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'\n \nexport default async function RemoteMdxPage() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, CMS, fetch, anywhere...\n  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n  const markdown = await res.text()\n  return <MDXRemote source={markdown} />\n}\n\nNavigating to the /my-mdx-page-remote route should display your rendered MDX.\nLayouts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo share a layout across MDX pages, you can use the built-in layouts support with the App Router.app/my-mdx-page/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function MdxLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return <div style={{ color: 'blue' }}>{children}</div>\n}\n\nRemark and Rehype Plugins\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can optionally provide remark and rehype plugins to transform the MDX content.\nFor example, you can use remark-gfm to support GitHub Flavored Markdown.\nSince the remark and rehype ecosystem is ESM only, you'll need to use next.config.mjs as the configuration file.\nnext.config.mjsimport remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'\nimport createMDX from '@next/mdx'\n \n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Configure `pageExtensions`` to include MDX files\n  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],\n  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below\n}\n \nconst withMDX = createMDX({\n  // Add markdown plugins here, as desired\n  options: {\n    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],\n    rehypePlugins: [],\n  },\n})\n \n// Wrap MDX and Next.js config with each other\nexport default withMDX(nextConfig)\nFrontmatter\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFrontmatter is a YAML like key/value pairing that can be used to store data about a page. @next/mdx does not support frontmatter by default, though there are many solutions for adding frontmatter to your MDX content, such as:\n\nremark-frontmatter\nremark-mdx-frontmatter\ngray-matter.\n\nTo access page metadata with @next/mdx, you can export a metadata object from within the .mdx file:\nexport const metadata = {\n  author: 'John Doe',\n}\n \n# My MDX page\nCustom Elements\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOne of the pleasant aspects of using markdown, is that it maps to native HTML elements, making writing fast, and intuitive:\nThis is a list in markdown:\n \n- One\n- Two\n- Three\nThe above generates the following HTML:\n<p>This is a list in markdown:</p>\n \n<ul>\n  <li>One</li>\n  <li>Two</li>\n  <li>Three</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you want to style your own elements for a custom feel to your website or application, you can pass in shortcodes. These are your own custom components that map to HTML elements.\nTo do this, open the mdx-components.tsx file at the root of your application and add custom elements:\n\nmdx-components.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'\nimport Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \n// This file allows you to provide custom React components\n// to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any\n// React component you want, including inline styles,\n// components from other libraries, and more.\n \nexport function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {\n  return {\n    // Allows customizing built-in components, e.g. to add styling.\n    h1: ({ children }) => <h1 style={{ fontSize: '100px' }}>{children}</h1>,\n    img: (props) => (\n      <Image\n        sizes=\"100vw\"\n        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}\n        {...(props as ImageProps)}\n      />\n    ),\n    ...components,\n  }\n}\n\nDeep Dive: How do you transform markdown into HTML?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nReact does not natively understand markdown. The markdown plaintext needs to first be transformed into HTML. This can be accomplished with remark and rehype.\nremark is an ecosystem of tools around markdown. rehype is the same, but for HTML. For example, the following code snippet transforms markdown into HTML:\nimport { unified } from 'unified'\nimport remarkParse from 'remark-parse'\nimport remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'\nimport rehypeSanitize from 'rehype-sanitize'\nimport rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'\n \nmain()\n \nasync function main() {\n  const file = await unified()\n    .use(remarkParse) // Convert into markdown AST\n    .use(remarkRehype) // Transform to HTML AST\n    .use(rehypeSanitize) // Sanitize HTML input\n    .use(rehypeStringify) // Convert AST into serialized HTML\n    .process('Hello, Next.js!')\n \n  console.log(String(file)) // <p>Hello, Next.js!</p>\n}\nThe remark and rehype ecosystem contains plugins for syntax highlighting, linking headings, generating a table of contents, and more.\nWhen using @next/mdx as shown above, you do not need to use remark or rehype directly, as it is handled for you. We're describing it here for a deeper understanding of what the @next/mdx package is doing underneath.\nUsing the Rust-based MDX compiler (Experimental)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js supports a new MDX compiler written in Rust. This compiler is still experimental and is not recommended for production use.

For non-literal strings, you currently need to manually cast the href with as Route:import type { Route } from 'next';\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \n// No TypeScript errors if href is a valid route\n<Link href=\"/about\" />\n<Link href=\"/blog/nextjs\" />\n<Link href={`/blog/${slug}`} />\n<Link href={('/blog' + slug) as Route} />\n \n// TypeScript errors if href is not a valid route\n<Link href=\"/aboot\" />To accept href in a custom component wrapping next/link, use a generic:import type { Route } from 'next'\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Card<T extends string>({ href }: { href: Route<T> | URL }) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={href}>\n      <div>My Card</div>\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\nHow does it work?\nWhen running next dev or next build, Next.js generates a hidden .d.ts file inside .next that contains information about all existing routes in your application (all valid routes as the href type of Link). This .d.ts file is included in tsconfig.json and the TypeScript compiler will check that .d.ts and provide feedback in your editor about invalid links.\nEnd-to-End Type Safety\n  \n    \n    \n  \nThe Next.js App Router has enhanced type safety. This includes:\nNo serialization of data between fetching function and page: You can fetch directly in components, layouts, and pages on the server. This data does not need to be serialized (converted to a string) to be passed to the client side for consumption in React. Instead, since app uses Server Components by default, we can use values like Date, Map, Set, and more without any extra steps. Previously, you needed to manually type the boundary between server and client with Next.js-specific types.\nStreamlined data flow between components: With the removal of _app in favor of root layouts, it is now easier to visualize the data flow between components and pages. Previously, data flowing between individual pages and _app were difficult to type and could introduce confusing bugs. With colocated data fetching in the App Router, this is no longer an issue.\nData Fetching in Next.js now provides as close to end-to-end type safety as possible without being prescriptive about your database or content provider selection.We're able to type the response data as you would expect with normal TypeScript. For example:app/page.tsxasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')\n  // The return value is *not* serialized\n  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.\n  return res.json()\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const name = await getData()\n \n  return '...'\n}For complete end-to-end type safety, this also requires your database or content provider to support TypeScript. This could be through using an ORM or type-safe query builder.Async Server Component TypeScript Error\n  \n    \n    \n  \nTo use an async Server Component with TypeScript, ensure you are using TypeScript 5.1.3 or higher and @types/react 18.2.8 or higher.If you are using an older version of TypeScript, you may see a 'Promise<Element>' is not a valid JSX element type error. Updating to the latest version of TypeScript and @types/react should resolve this issue.Passing Data Between Server & Client Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \nWhen passing data between a Server and Client Component through props, the data is still serialized (converted to a string) for use in the browser. However, it does not need a special type. It’s typed the same as passing any other props between components.Further, there is less code to be serialized, as un-rendered data does not cross between the server and client (it remains on the server). This is only now possible through support for Server Components.\n\nPath aliases and baseUrl\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js automatically supports the tsconfig.json \"paths\" and \"baseUrl\" options.\nYou can learn more about this feature on the Module Path aliases documentation.\n\nType checking next.config.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe next.config.js file must be a JavaScript file as it does not get parsed by Babel or TypeScript, however you can add some type checking in your IDE using JSDoc as below:\n// @ts-check\n \n/**\n * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\n **/\nconst nextConfig = {\n  /* config options here */\n}\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig\nIncremental type checking\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSince v10.2.1 Next.js supports incremental type checking when enabled in your tsconfig.json, this can help speed up type checking in larger applications.\nIgnoring TypeScript Errors\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js fails your production build (next build) when TypeScript errors are present in your project.\nIf you'd like Next.js to dangerously produce production code even when your application has errors, you can disable the built-in type checking step.\nIf disabled, be sure you are running type checks as part of your build or deploy process, otherwise this can be very dangerous.\nOpen next.config.js and enable the ignoreBuildErrors option in the typescript config:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  typescript: {\n    // !! WARN !!\n    // Dangerously allow production builds to successfully complete even if\n    // your project has type errors.\n    // !! WARN !!\n    ignoreBuildErrors: true,\n  },\n}\nCustom Type Declarations\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen you need to declare custom types, you might be tempted to modify next-env.d.ts. However, this file is automatically generated, so any changes you make will be overwritten. Instead, you should create a new file, let's call it new-types.d.ts, and reference it in your tsconfig.json:\ntsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true\n    //...truncated...\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"new-types.d.ts\",\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n    \".next/types/**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.tsx\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\nVersion Changes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.2.0Statically typed links are available in beta.v12.0.0SWC is now used by default to compile TypeScript and TSX for faster builds.v10.2.1Incremental type checking support added when enabled in your tsconfig.json."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_data-fetching.txt","text":"Data Fetching"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_data-fetching_fetching-caching-and-revalidating.txt","text":"Data Fetching, Caching, and RevalidatingData fetching is a core part of any application. This page goes through how you can fetch, cache, and revalidate data in React and Next.js.\nThere are four ways you can fetch data:\n\nOn the server, with fetch\nOn the server, with third-party libraries\nOn the client, via a Route Handler\nOn the client, with third-party libraries.\n\nFetching Data on the Server with fetch\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js extends the native fetch Web API to allow you to configure the caching and revalidating behavior for each fetch request on the server. React extends fetch to automatically memoize fetch requests while rendering a React component tree.\nYou can use fetch with async/await in Server Components, in Route Handlers, and in Server Actions.\nFor example:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')\n  // The return value is *not* serialized\n  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.\n \n  if (!res.ok) {\n    // This will activate the closest `error.js` Error Boundary\n    throw new Error('Failed to fetch data')\n  }\n \n  return res.json()\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const data = await getData()\n \n  return <main></main>\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nNext.js provides helpful functions you may need when fetching data in Server Components such as cookies and headers. These will cause the route to be dynamically rendered as they rely on request time information.\nIn Route handlers, fetch requests are not memoized as Route Handlers are not part of the React component tree.\nIn Server Actions, fetch requests are not cached (defaults cache: no-store).\nTo use async/await in a Server Component with TypeScript, you'll need to use TypeScript 5.1.3 or higher and @types/react 18.2.8 or higher.\n\n\nCaching Data\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCaching stores data so it doesn't need to be re-fetched from your data source on every request.\nBy default, Next.js automatically caches the returned values of fetch in the Data Cache on the server. This means that the data can be fetched at build time or request time, cached, and reused on each data request.\n// 'force-cache' is the default, and can be omitted\nfetch('https://...', { cache: 'force-cache' })\nHowever, there are exceptions, fetch requests are not cached when:\n\nUsed inside a Server Action.\nUsed inside a Route Handler that uses the POST method.\n\n\nWhat is the Data Cache?\nThe Data Cache is a persistent HTTP cache. Depending on your platform, the cache can scale automatically and be shared across multiple regions.\nLearn more about the Data Cache.\n\nRevalidating Data\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nRevalidation is the process of purging the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data. This is useful when your data changes and you want to ensure you show the latest information.\nCached data can be revalidated in two ways:\n\nTime-based revalidation: Automatically revalidate data after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for data that changes infrequently and freshness is not as critical.\nOn-demand revalidation: Manually revalidate data based on an event (e.g. form submission). On-demand revalidation can use a tag-based or path-based approach to revalidate groups of data at once. This is useful when you want to ensure the latest data is shown as soon as possible (e.g. when content from your headless CMS is updated).\n\nTime-based Revalidation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo revalidate data at a timed interval, you can use the next.revalidate option of fetch to set the cache lifetime of a resource (in seconds).\nfetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })\nAlternatively, to revalidate all fetch requests in a route segment, you can use the Segment Config Options.\nlayout.js | page.jsexport const revalidate = 3600 // revalidate at most every hour\nIf you have multiple fetch requests in a statically rendered route, and each has a different revalidation frequency. The lowest time will be used for all requests. For dynamically rendered routes, each fetch request will be revalidated independently.\nLearn more about time-based revalidation.\nOn-demand Revalidation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nData can be revalidated on-demand by path (revalidatePath) or by cache tag (revalidateTag) inside a Server Action or Route Handler.\nNext.js has a cache tagging system for invalidating fetch requests across routes.\n\nWhen using fetch, you have the option to tag cache entries with one or more tags.\nThen, you can call revalidateTag to revalidate all entries associated with that tag.\n\nFor example, the following fetch request adds the cache tag collection:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default async function Page() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://...', { next: { tags: ['collection'] } })\n  const data = await res.json()\n  // ...\n}\n\nYou can then revalidate this fetch call tagged with collection by calling revalidateTag in a Server Action:\napp/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default async function action() {\n  revalidateTag('collection')\n}\n\nLearn more about on-demand revalidation.\nError handling and revalidation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf an error is thrown while attempting to revalidate data, the last successfully generated data will continue to be served from the cache. On the next subsequent request, Next.js will retry revalidating the data.\nOpting out of Data Caching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nfetch requests are not cached if:\n\nThe cache: 'no-store' is added to fetch requests.\nThe revalidate: 0 option is added to individual fetch requests.\nThe fetch request is inside a Router Handler that uses the POST method.\nThe fetch request comes after the usage of headers or cookies.\nThe const dynamic = 'force-dynamic' route segment option is used.\nThe fetchCache route segment option is configured to skip cache by default.\nThe fetch request uses Authorization or Cookie headers and there's an uncached request above it in the component tree.\n\nIndividual fetch Requests\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo opt out of caching for individual fetch requests, you can set the cache option in fetch to 'no-store'. This will fetch data dynamically, on every request.\nlayout.js | page.jsfetch('https://...', { cache: 'no-store' })\nView all the available cache options in the fetch API reference.\nMultiple fetch Requests\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you have multiple fetch requests in a route segment (e.g. a Layout or Page), you can configure the caching behavior of all data requests in the segment using the Segment Config Options.\nHowever, we recommend configuring the caching behavior of each fetch request individually. This gives you more granular control over the caching behavior.\nFetching data on the Server with third-party libraries\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn cases where you're using a third-party library that doesn't support or expose fetch (for example, a database, CMS, or ORM client), you can configure the caching and revalidating behavior of those requests using the Route Segment Config Option and React's cache function.\nWhether the data is cached or not will depend on whether the route segment is statically or dynamically rendered. If the segment is static (default), the output of the request will be cached and revalidated as part of the route segment. If the segment is dynamic, the output of the request will not be cached and will be re-fetched on every request when the segment is rendered.\nYou can also use the experimental unstable_cache API.\nExample\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the example below:\n\nThe React cache function is used to memoize data requests.\nThe revalidate option is set to 3600 in the Layout and Page segments, meaning the data will be cached and revalidated at most every hour.\n\napp/utils.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { cache } from 'react'\n \nexport const getItem = cache(async (id: string) => {\n  const item = await db.item.findUnique({ id })\n  return item\n})\n\nAlthough the getItem function is called twice, only one query will be made to the database.\napp/item/[id]/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { getItem } from '@/utils/get-item'\n \nexport const revalidate = 3600 // revalidate the data at most every hour\n \nexport default async function Layout({\n  params: { id },\n}: {\n  params: { id: string }\n}) {\n  const item = await getItem(id)\n  // ...\n}\n\napp/item/[id]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { getItem } from '@/utils/get-item'\n \nexport const revalidate = 3600 // revalidate the data at most every hour\n \nexport default async function Page({\n  params: { id },\n}: {\n  params: { id: string }\n}) {\n  const item = await getItem(id)\n  // ...\n}\n\nFetching Data on the Client with Route Handlers\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you need to fetch data in a client component, you can call a Route Handler from the client. Route Handlers execute on the server and return the data to the client. This is useful when you don't want to expose sensitive information to the client, such as API tokens.\nSee the Route Handler documentation for examples.\n\nServer Components and Route Handlers\nSince Server Components render on the server, you don't need to call a Route Handler from a Server Component to fetch data. Instead, you can fetch the data directly inside the Server Component.\n\nFetching Data on the Client with third-party libraries\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can also fetch data on the client using a third-party library such as SWR or TanStack Query. These libraries provide their own APIs for memoizing requests, caching, revalidating, and mutating data.\n\nFuture APIs:\nuse is a React function that accepts and handles a promise returned by a function. Wrapping fetch in use is currently not recommended in Client Components and may trigger multiple re-renders. Learn more about use in the React docs.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_data-fetching_patterns.txt","text":"Patterns and Best PracticesThere are a few recommended patterns and best practices for fetching data in React and Next.js. This page will go over some of the most common patterns and how to use them.\nFetching data on the server\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhenever possible, we recommend fetching data on the server with Server Components. This allows you to:\n\nHave direct access to backend data resources (e.g. databases).\nKeep your application more secure by preventing sensitive information, such as access tokens and API keys, from being exposed to the client.\nFetch data and render in the same environment. This reduces both the back-and-forth communication between client and server, as well as the work on the main thread on the client.\nPerform multiple data fetches with single round-trip instead of multiple individual requests on the client.\nReduce client-server waterfalls.\nDepending on your region, data fetching can also happen closer to your data source, reducing latency and improving performance.\n\nThen, you can mutate or update data with Server Actions.\nFetching data where it's needed\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you need to use the same data (e.g. current user) in multiple components in a tree, you do not have to fetch data globally, nor forward props between components. Instead, you can use fetch or React cache in the component that needs the data without worrying about the performance implications of making multiple requests for the same data.\nThis is possible because fetch requests are automatically memoized. Learn more about request memoization\n\nGood to know: This also applies to layouts, since it's not possible to pass data between a parent layout and its children.\n\nStreaming\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nStreaming and Suspense are React features that allow you to progressively render and incrementally stream rendered units of the UI to the client.\nWith Server Components and nested layouts, you're able to instantly render parts of the page that do not specifically require data, and show a loading state for parts of the page that are fetching data. This means the user does not have to wait for the entire page to load before they can start interacting with it.\n\nTo learn more about Streaming and Suspense, see the Loading UI and Streaming and Suspense pages.\nParallel and sequential data fetching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen fetching data inside React components, you need to be aware of two data fetching patterns: Parallel and Sequential.\n\n\nWith sequential data fetching, requests in a route are dependent on each other and therefore create waterfalls. There may be cases where you want this pattern because one fetch depends on the result of the other, or you want a condition to be satisfied before the next fetch to save resources. However, this behavior can also be unintentional and lead to longer loading times.\nWith parallel data fetching, requests in a route are eagerly initiated and will load data at the same time. This reduces client-server waterfalls and the total time it takes to load data.\n\nSequential Data Fetching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you have nested components, and each component fetches its own data, then data fetching will happen sequentially if those data requests are different (this doesn't apply to requests for the same data as they are automatically memoized).\nFor example, the Playlists component will only start fetching data once the Artist component has finished fetching data because Playlists depends on the artistID prop:\napp/artist/[username]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// ...\n \nasync function Playlists({ artistID }: { artistID: string }) {\n  // Wait for the playlists\n  const playlists = await getArtistPlaylists(artistID)\n \n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {playlists.map((playlist) => (\n        <li key={playlist.id}>{playlist.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default async function Page({\n  params: { username },\n}: {\n  params: { username: string }\n}) {\n  // Wait for the artist\n  const artist = await getArtist(username)\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        <Playlists artistID={artist.id} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nIn cases like this, you can use loading.js (for route segments) or React <Suspense> (for nested components) to show an instant loading state while React streams in the result.\nThis will prevent the whole route from being blocked by data fetching, and the user will be able to interact with the parts of the page that are not blocked.\n\nBlocking Data Requests:\nAn alternative approach to prevent waterfalls is to fetch data globally, at the root of your application, but this will block rendering for all route segments beneath it until the data has finished loading. This can be described as \"all or nothing\" data fetching. Either you have the entire data for your page or application, or none.\nAny fetch requests with await will block rendering and data fetching for the entire tree beneath it, unless they are wrapped in a <Suspense> boundary or loading.js is used. Another alternative is to use parallel data fetching or the preload pattern.\n\nParallel Data Fetching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo fetch data in parallel, you can eagerly initiate requests by defining them outside the components that use the data, then calling them from inside the component. This saves time by initiating both requests in parallel, however, the user won't see the rendered result until both promises are resolved.\nIn the example below, the getArtist and getArtistAlbums functions are defined outside the Page component, then called inside the component, and we wait for both promises to resolve:\napp/artist/[username]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Albums from './albums'\n \nasync function getArtist(username: string) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}`)\n  return res.json()\n}\n \nasync function getArtistAlbums(username: string) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}/albums`)\n  return res.json()\n}\n \nexport default async function Page({\n  params: { username },\n}: {\n  params: { username: string }\n}) {\n  // Initiate both requests in parallel\n  const artistData = getArtist(username)\n  const albumsData = getArtistAlbums(username)\n \n  // Wait for the promises to resolve\n  const [artist, albums] = await Promise.all([artistData, albumsData])\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Albums list={albums}></Albums>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nTo improve the user experience, you can add a Suspense Boundary to break up the rendering work and show part of the result as soon as possible.\nPreloading Data\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAnother way to prevent waterfalls is to use the preload pattern. You can optionally create a preload function to further optimize parallel data fetching. With this approach, you don't have to pass promises down as props. The preload function can also have any name as it's a pattern, not an API.\ncomponents/Item.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { getItem } from '@/utils/get-item'\n \nexport const preload = (id: string) => {\n  // void evaluates the given expression and returns undefined\n  // https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void\n  void getItem(id)\n}\nexport default async function Item({ id }: { id: string }) {\n  const result = await getItem(id)\n  // ...\n}\n\napp/item/[id]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Item, { preload, checkIsAvailable } from '@/components/Item'\n \nexport default async function Page({\n  params: { id },\n}: {\n  params: { id: string }\n}) {\n  // starting loading item data\n  preload(id)\n  // perform another asynchronous task\n  const isAvailable = await checkIsAvailable()\n \n  return isAvailable ? <Item id={id} /> : null\n}\n\nUsing React cache, server-only, and the Preload Pattern\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can combine the cache function, the preload pattern, and the server-only package to create a data fetching utility that can be used throughout your app.\nutils/get-item.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { cache } from 'react'\nimport 'server-only'\n \nexport const preload = (id: string) => {\n  void getItem(id)\n}\n \nexport const getItem = cache(async (id: string) => {\n  // ...\n})\n\nWith this approach, you can eagerly fetch data, cache responses, and guarantee that this data fetching only happens on the server.\nThe utils/get-item exports can be used by Layouts, Pages, or other components to give them control over when an item's data is fetched.\n\nGood to know:\n\nWe recommend using the server-only package to make sure server data fetching functions are never used on the client.\n\n\nPreventing sensitive data from being exposed to the client\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWe recommend using React's taint APIs, taintObjectReference and taintUniqueValue, to prevent whole object instances or sensitive values from being passed to the client.\nTo enable tainting in your application, set the Next.js Config experimental.taint option to true:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    taint: true,\n  },\n}\nThen pass the object or value you want to taint to the experimental_taintObjectReference or experimental_taintUniqueValue functions:\napp/utils.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { queryDataFromDB } from './api'\nimport {\n  experimental_taintObjectReference,\n  experimental_taintUniqueValue,\n} from 'react'\n \nexport async function getUserData() {\n  const data = await queryDataFromDB()\n  experimental_taintObjectReference(\n    'Do not pass the whole user object to the client',\n    data\n  )\n  experimental_taintUniqueValue(\n    \"Do not pass the user's address to the client\",\n    data,\n    data.address\n  )\n  return data\n}\n\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { getUserData } from './data'\n \nexport async function Page() {\n  const userData = getUserData()\n  return (\n    <ClientComponent\n      user={userData} // this will cause an error because of taintObjectReference\n      address={userData.address} // this will cause an error because of taintUniqueValue\n    />\n  )\n}\n\nLearn more about Security and Server Actions."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_data-fetching_server-actions-and-mutations.txt","text":"Server Actions and MutationsServer Actions are asynchronous functions that are executed on the server. They can be used in Server and Client Components to handle form submissions and data mutations in Next.js applications.\n\n🎥 Watch: Learn more about forms and mutations with Server Actions → YouTube (10 minutes).\n\nConvention\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA Server Action can be defined with the React \"use server\" directive. You can place the directive at the top of an async function to mark the function as a Server Action, or at the top of a separate file to mark all exports of that file as Server Actions.\nServer Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nServer Components can use the inline function level or module level \"use server\" directive. To inline a Server Action, add \"use server\" to the top of the function body:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// Server Component\nexport default function Page() {\n  // Server Action\n  async function create() {\n    'use server'\n \n    // ...\n  }\n \n  return (\n    // ...\n  )\n}\n\nClient Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nClient Components can only import actions that use the module-level \"use server\" directive.\nTo call a Server Action in a Client Component, create a new file and add the \"use server\" directive at the top of it. All functions within the file will be marked as Server Actions that can be reused in both Client and Server Components:\napp/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nexport async function create() {\n  // ...\n}\n\napp/ui/button.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { create } from '@/app/actions'\n \nexport function Button() {\n  return (\n    // ...\n  )\n}\n\nYou can also pass a Server Action to a Client Component as a prop:\n<ClientComponent updateItem={updateItem} />\napp/client-component.jsx'use client'\n \nexport default function ClientComponent({ updateItem }) {\n  return <form action={updateItem}>{/* ... */}</form>\n}\nBehavior\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nServer actions can be invoked using the action attribute in a <form> element:\n\nServer Components support progressive enhancement by default, meaning the form will be submitted even if JavaScript hasn't loaded yet or is disabled.\nIn Client Components, forms invoking Server Actions will queue submissions if JavaScript isn't loaded yet, prioritizing client hydration.\nAfter hydration, the browser does not refresh on form submission.\n\n\nServer Actions are not limited to <form> and can be invoked from event handlers, useEffect, third-party libraries, and other form elements like <button>.\nServer Actions integrate with the Next.js caching and revalidation architecture. When an action is invoked, Next.js can return both the updated UI and new data in a single server roundtrip.\nBehind the scenes, actions use the POST method, and only this HTTP method can invoke them.\nThe arguments and return value of Server Actions must be serializable by React. See the React docs for a list of serializable arguments and values.\nServer Actions are functions. This means they can be reused anywhere in your application.\nServer Actions inherit the runtime from the page or layout they are used on.\nServer Actions inherit the Route Segment Config from the page or layout they are used on, including fields like maxDuration.\n\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nForms\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nReact extends the HTML <form> element to allow Server Actions to be invoked with the action prop.\nWhen invoked in a form, the action automatically receives the FormData object. You don't need to use React useState to manage fields, instead, you can extract the data using the native FormData methods:\napp/invoices/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page() {\n  async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {\n    'use server'\n \n    const rawFormData = {\n      customerId: formData.get('customerId'),\n      amount: formData.get('amount'),\n      status: formData.get('status'),\n    }\n \n    // mutate data\n    // revalidate cache\n  }\n \n  return <form action={createInvoice}>...</form>\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nExample: Form with Loading & Error States\nWhen working with forms that have many fields, you may want to consider using the entries() method with JavaScript's Object.fromEntries(). For example: const rawFormData = Object.fromEntries(formData). One thing to note is that the formData will include additional $ACTION_ properties.\nSee React <form> documentation to learn more.\n\n\nPassing Additional Arguments\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can pass additional arguments to a Server Action using the JavaScript bind method.\napp/client-component.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { updateUser } from './actions'\n \nexport function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const updateUserWithId = updateUser.bind(null, userId)\n \n  return (\n    <form action={updateUserWithId}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Update User Name</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n\nThe Server Action will receive the userId argument, in addition to the form data:\napp/actions.js'use server'\n \nexport async function updateUser(userId, formData) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nAn alternative is to pass arguments as hidden input fields in the form (e.g. <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"userId\" value={userId} />). However, the value will be part of the rendered HTML and will not be encoded.\n.bind works in both Server and Client Components. It also supports progressive enhancement.\n\n\nPending states\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use the React useFormStatus hook to show a pending state while the form is being submitted.\n\nuseFormStatus returns the status for a specific <form>, so it must be defined as a child of the <form> element.\nuseFormStatus is a React hook and therefore must be used in a Client Component.\n\napp/submit-button.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom'\n \nexport function SubmitButton() {\n  const { pending } = useFormStatus()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"submit\" disabled={pending}>\n      Add\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n\n<SubmitButton /> can then be nested in any form:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { SubmitButton } from '@/app/submit-button'\nimport { createItem } from '@/app/actions'\n \n// Server Component\nexport default async function Home() {\n  return (\n    <form action={createItem}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"field-name\" />\n      <SubmitButton />\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n\nServer-side validation and error handling\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWe recommend using HTML validation like required and type=\"email\" for basic client-side form validation.\nFor more advanced server-side validation, you can use a library like zod to validate the form fields before mutating the data:\napp/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nimport { z } from 'zod'\n \nconst schema = z.object({\n  email: z.string({\n    invalid_type_error: 'Invalid Email',\n  }),\n})\n \nexport default async function createUser(formData: FormData) {\n  const validatedFields = schema.safeParse({\n    email: formData.get('email'),\n  })\n \n  // Return early if the form data is invalid\n  if (!validatedFields.success) {\n    return {\n      errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,\n    }\n  }\n \n  // Mutate data\n}\n\nOnce the fields have been validated on the server, you can return a serializable object in your action and use the React useFormState hook to show a message to the user.\n\nBy passing the action to useFormState, the action's function signature changes to receive a new prevState or initialState parameter as its first argument.\nuseFormState is a React hook and therefore must be used in a Client Component.\n\napp/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nexport async function createUser(prevState: any, formData: FormData) {\n  // ...\n  return {\n    message: 'Please enter a valid email',\n  }\n}\n\nThen, you can pass your action to the useFormState hook and use the returned state to display an error message.\napp/ui/signup.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useFormState } from 'react-dom'\nimport { createUser } from '@/app/actions'\n \nconst initialState = {\n  message: '',\n}\n \nexport function Signup() {\n  const [state, formAction] = useFormState(createUser, initialState)\n \n  return (\n    <form action={formAction}>\n      <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n      <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required />\n      {/* ... */}\n      <p aria-live=\"polite\" className=\"sr-only\">\n        {state?.message}\n      </p>\n      <button>Sign up</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nBefore mutating data, you should always ensure a user is also authorized to perform the action. See Authentication and Authorization.\n\n\nOptimistic updates\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use the React useOptimistic hook to optimistically update the UI before the Server Action finishes, rather than waiting for the response:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useOptimistic } from 'react'\nimport { send } from './actions'\n \ntype Message = {\n  message: string\n}\n \nexport function Thread({ messages }: { messages: Message[] }) {\n  const [optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic<\n    Message[],\n    string\n  >(messages, (state, newMessage) => [...state, { message: newMessage }])\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      {optimisticMessages.map((m, k) => (\n        <div key={k}>{m.message}</div>\n      ))}\n      <form\n        action={async (formData: FormData) => {\n          const message = formData.get('message')\n          addOptimisticMessage(message)\n          await send(message)\n        }}\n      >\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nNested elements\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can invoke a Server Action in elements nested inside <form> such as <button>, <input type=\"submit\">, and <input type=\"image\">. These elements accept the formAction prop or event handlers.\nThis is useful in cases where you want to call multiple server actions within a form. For example, you can create a specific <button> element for saving a post draft in addition to publishing it. See the React <form> docs for more information.\nProgrammatic form submission\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can trigger a form submission using the requestSubmit() method. For example, when the user presses ⌘ + Enter, you can listen for the onKeyDown event:\napp/entry.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nexport function Entry() {\n  const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {\n    if (\n      (e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) &&\n      (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === 'NumpadEnter')\n    ) {\n      e.preventDefault()\n      e.currentTarget.form?.requestSubmit()\n    }\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <textarea name=\"entry\" rows={20} required onKeyDown={handleKeyDown} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nThis will trigger the submission of the nearest <form> ancestor, which will invoke the Server Action.\nNon-form Elements\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhile it's common to use Server Actions within <form> elements, they can also be invoked from other parts of your code such as event handlers and useEffect.\nEvent Handlers\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can invoke a Server Action from event handlers such as onClick. For example, to increment a like count:\napp/like-button.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { incrementLike } from './actions'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n \nexport default function LikeButton({ initialLikes }: { initialLikes: number }) {\n  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(initialLikes)\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <p>Total Likes: {likes}</p>\n      <button\n        onClick={async () => {\n          const updatedLikes = await incrementLike()\n          setLikes(updatedLikes)\n        }}\n      >\n        Like\n      </button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nTo improve the user experience, we recommend using other React APIs like useOptimistic and useTransition to update the UI before the Server Action finishes executing on the server, or to show a pending state.\nYou can also add event handlers to form elements, for example, to save a form field onChange:\napp/ui/edit-post.tsx'use client'\n \nimport { publishPost, saveDraft } from './actions'\n \nexport default function EditPost() {\n  return (\n    <form action={publishPost}>\n      <textarea\n        name=\"content\"\n        onChange={async (e) => {\n          await saveDraft(e.target.value)\n        }}\n      />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Publish</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\nFor cases like this, where multiple events might be fired in quick succession, we recommend debouncing to prevent unnecessary Server Action invocations.\nuseEffect\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use the React useEffect hook to invoke a Server Action when the component mounts or a dependency changes. This is useful for mutations that depend on global events or need to be triggered automatically. For example, onKeyDown for app shortcuts, an intersection observer hook for infinite scrolling, or when the component mounts to update a view count:\napp/view-count.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { incrementViews } from './actions'\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n \nexport default function ViewCount({ initialViews }: { initialViews: number }) {\n  const [views, setViews] = useState(initialViews)\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const updateViews = async () => {\n      const updatedViews = await incrementViews()\n      setViews(updatedViews)\n    }\n \n    updateViews()\n  }, [])\n \n  return <p>Total Views: {views}</p>\n}\n\nRemember to consider the behavior and caveats of useEffect.\nError Handling\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen an error is thrown, it'll be caught by the nearest error.js or <Suspense> boundary on the client. We recommend using try/catch to return errors to be handled by your UI.\nFor example, your Server Action might handle errors from creating a new item by returning a message:\napp/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nexport async function createTodo(prevState: any, formData: FormData) {\n  try {\n    // Mutate data\n  } catch (e) {\n    throw new Error('Failed to create task')\n  }\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nAside from throwing the error, you can also return an object to be handled by useFormState. See Server-side validation and error handling.\n\n\nRevalidating data\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can revalidate the Next.js Cache inside your Server Actions with the revalidatePath API:\napp/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport async function createPost() {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } catch (error) {\n    // ...\n  }\n \n  revalidatePath('/posts')\n}\n\nOr invalidate a specific data fetch with a cache tag using revalidateTag:\napp/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport async function createPost() {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } catch (error) {\n    // ...\n  }\n \n  revalidateTag('posts')\n}\n\nRedirecting\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you would like to redirect the user to a different route after the completion of a Server Action, you can use redirect API. redirect needs to be called outside of the try/catch block:\napp/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport async function createPost(id: string) {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } catch (error) {\n    // ...\n  }\n \n  revalidateTag('posts') // Update cached posts\n  redirect(`/post/${id}`) // Navigate to the new post page\n}\n\nCookies\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can get, set, and delete cookies inside a Server Action using the cookies API:\napp/actions.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use server'\n \nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport async function exampleAction() {\n  // Get cookie\n  const value = cookies().get('name')?.value\n \n  // Set cookie\n  cookies().set('name', 'Delba')\n \n  // Delete cookie\n  cookies().delete('name')\n}\n\nSee additional examples for deleting cookies from Server Actions.\nSecurity\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAuthentication and authorization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou should treat Server Actions as you would public-facing API endpoints, and ensure that the user is authorized to perform the action. For example:\napp/actions.ts'use server'\n \nimport { auth } from './lib'\n \nexport function addItem() {\n  const { user } = auth()\n  if (!user) {\n    throw new Error('You must be signed in to perform this action')\n  }\n \n  // ...\n}\nClosures and encryption\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDefining a Server Action inside a component creates a closure where the action has access to the outer function's scope. For example, the publish action has access to the publishVersion variable:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page() {\n  const publishVersion = await getLatestVersion();\n \n  async function publish(formData: FormData) {\n    \"use server\";\n    if (publishVersion !== await getLatestVersion()) {\n      throw new Error('The version has changed since pressing publish');\n    }\n    ...\n  }\n \n  return <button action={publish}>Publish</button>;\n}\n\nClosures are useful when you need to capture a snapshot of data (e.g. publishVersion) at the time of rendering so that it can be used later when the action is invoked.\nHowever, for this to happen, the captured variables are sent to the client and back to the server when the action is invoked. To prevent sensitive data from being exposed to the client, Next.js automatically encrypts the closed-over variables. A new private key is generated for each action every time a Next.js application is built. This means actions can only be invoked for a specific build.\n\nGood to know: We don't recommend relying on encryption alone to prevent sensitive values from being exposed on the client. Instead, you should use the React taint APIs to proactively prevent specific data from being sent to the client.\n\nOverwriting encryption keys (advanced)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen self-hosting your Next.js application across multiple servers, each server instance may end up with a different encryption key, leading to potential inconsistencies.\nTo mitigate this, you can overwrite the encryption key using the process.env.NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable. Specifying this variable ensures that your encryption keys are persistent across builds, and all server instances use the same key.\nThis is an advanced use case where consistent encryption behavior across multiple deployments is critical for your application. You should consider standard security practices such key rotation and signing.\n\nGood to know: Next.js applications deployed to Vercel automatically handle this.\n\nAllowed origins (advanced)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSince Server Actions can be invoked in a <form> element, this opens them up to CSRF attacks.\nBehind the scenes, Server Actions use the POST method, and only this HTTP method is allowed to invoke them. This prevents most CSRF vulnerabilities in modern browsers, particularly with SameSite cookies being the default.\nAs an additional protection, Server Actions in Next.js also compare the Origin header to the Host header (or X-Forwarded-Host). If these don't match, the request will be aborted. In other words, Server Actions can only be invoked on the same host as the page that hosts it.\nFor large applications that use reverse proxies or multi-layered backend architectures (where the server API differs from the production domain), it's recommended to use the configuration option serverActions.allowedOrigins option to specify a list of safe origins. The option accepts an array of strings.\nnext.config.js/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    serverActions: {\n      allowedOrigins: ['my-proxy.com', '*.my-proxy.com'],\n    },\n  },\n}\nLearn more about Security and Server Actions.\nAdditional resources\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor more information on Server Actions, check out the following React docs:\n\n\"use server\"\n<form>\nuseFormStatus\nuseFormState\nuseOptimistic\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_deploying.txt","text":"Deploying\nCongratulations, it's time to ship to production.\nYou can deploy managed Next.js with Vercel, or self-host on a Node.js server, Docker image, or even static HTML files. When deploying using next start, all Next.js features are supported.\nProduction Builds\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nRunning next build generates an optimized version of your application for production. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are created based on your pages. JavaScript is compiled and browser bundles are minified using the Next.js Compiler to help achieve the best performance and support all modern browsers.\nNext.js produces a standard deployment output used by managed and self-hosted Next.js. This ensures all features are supported across both methods of deployment. In the next major version, we will be transforming this output into our Build Output API specification.\nManaged Next.js with Vercel\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVercel, the creators and maintainers of Next.js, provide managed infrastructure and a developer experience platform for your Next.js applications.\nDeploying to Vercel is zero-configuration and provides additional enhancements for scalability, availability, and performance globally. However, all Next.js features are still supported when self-hosted.\nLearn more about Next.js on Vercel or deploy a template for free to try it out.\nSelf-Hosting\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can self-host Next.js in three different ways:\n\nA Node.js server\nA Docker container\nA static export\n\nNode.js Server\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js. Ensure your package.json has the \"build\" and \"start\" scripts:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\nThen, run npm run build to build your application. Finally, run npm run start to start the Node.js server. This server supports all Next.js features.\nDocker Image\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Docker containers. You can use this approach when deploying to container orchestrators such as Kubernetes or when running inside a container in any cloud provider.\n\nInstall Docker on your machine\nClone our example (or the multi-environment example)\nBuild your container: docker build -t nextjs-docker .\nRun your container: docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-docker\n\nNext.js through Docker supports all Next.js features.\nStatic HTML Export\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server.\nSince Next.js supports this static export, it can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets. This includes tools like AWS S3, Nginx, or Apache.\nRunning as a static export does not support Next.js features that require a server. Learn more.\n\nGood to know:\n\nServer Components are supported with static exports.\n\n\nFeatures\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nImage Optimization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nImage Optimization through next/image works self-hosted with zero configuration when deploying using next start. If you would prefer to have a separate service to optimize images, you can configure an image loader.\nImage Optimization can be used with a static export by defining a custom image loader in next.config.js. Note that images are optimized at runtime, not during the build.\n\nGood to know:\n\nWhen self-hosting, consider installing sharp for more performant Image Optimization in your production environment by running npm install sharp in your project directory. On Linux platforms, sharp may require additional configuration to prevent excessive memory usage.\nLearn more about the caching behavior of optimized images and how to configure the TTL.\nYou can also disable Image Optimization and still retain other benefits of using next/image if you prefer. For example, if you are optimizing images yourself separately.\n\n\nMiddleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware works self-hosted with zero configuration when deploying using next start. Since it requires access to the incoming request, it is not supported when using a static export.\nMiddleware uses a runtime that is a subset of all available Node.js APIs to help ensure low latency, since it may run in front of every route or asset in your application. This runtime does not require running “at the edge” and works in a single-region server. Additional configuration and infrastructure are required to run Middleware in multiple regions.\nIf you are looking to add logic (or use an external package) that requires all Node.js APIs, you might be able to move this logic to a layout as a Server Component. For example, checking headers and redirecting. You can also use headers, cookies, or query parameters to redirect or rewrite through next.config.js. If that does not work, you can also use a custom server.\nEnvironment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can support both build time and runtime environment variables.\nBy default, environment variables are only available on the server. To expose an environment variable to the browser, it must be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_. However, these public environment variables will be inlined into the JavaScript bundle during next build.\nTo read runtime environment variables, we recommend using getServerSideProps or incrementally adopting the App Router. With the App Router, we can safely read environment variables on the server during dynamic rendering. This allows you to use a singular Docker image that can be promoted through multiple environments with different values.\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache';\n \nexport default function Component() {\n  noStore();\n  // cookies(), headers(), and other dynamic functions\n  // will also opt into dynamic rendering, making\n  // this env variable is evaluated at runtime\n  const value = process.env.MY_VALUE\n  ...\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nYou can run code on server startup using the register function.\nWe do not recommend using the runtimeConfig option, as this does not work with the standalone output mode. Instead, we recommend incrementally adopting the App Router.\n\n\nCaching and ISR\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can cache responses, generated static pages, build outputs, and other static assets like images, fonts, and scripts.\nCaching and revalidating pages (using Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) or newer functions in the App Router) use the same shared cache. By default, this cache is stored to the filesystem (on disk) on your Next.js server. This works automatically when self-hosting using both the Pages and App Router.\nYou can configure the Next.js cache location if you want to persist cached pages and data to durable storage, or share the cache across multiple containers or instances of your Next.js application.\nAutomatic Caching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nNext.js sets the Cache-Control header of public, max-age=31536000, immutable to truly immutable assets. It cannot be overridden. These immutable files contain a SHA-hash in the file name, so they can be safely cached indefinitely. For example, Static Image Imports. You can configure the TTL for images.\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR) sets the Cache-Control header of s-maxage: <revalidate in getStaticProps>, stale-while-revalidate. This revalidation time is defined in your getStaticProps function in seconds. If you set revalidate: false, it will default to a one-year cache duration.\nDynamically rendered pages set a Cache-Control header of private, no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate to prevent user-specific data from being cached. This applies to both the App Router and Pages Router. This also includes Draft Mode.\n\nStatic Assets\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to host static assets on a different domain or CDN, you can use the assetPrefix configuration in next.config.js. Next.js will use this asset prefix when retrieving JavaScript or CSS files. Separating your assets to a different domain does come with the downside of extra time spent on DNS and TLS resolution.\nLearn more about assetPrefix.\nConfiguring Caching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, generated cache assets will be stored in memory (defaults to 50mb) and on disk. If you are hosting Next.js using a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes, each pod will have a copy of the cache. To prevent stale data from being shown since the cache is not shared between pods by default, you can configure the Next.js cache to provide a cache handler and disable in-memory caching.\nTo configure the ISR/Data Cache location when self-hosting, you can configure a custom handler in your next.config.js file:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  cacheHandler: require.resolve('./cache-handler.js'),\n  cacheMaxMemorySize: 0, // disable default in-memory caching\n}\nThen, create cache-handler.js in the root of your project, for example:\ncache-handler.jsconst cache = new Map()\n \nmodule.exports = class CacheHandler {\n  constructor(options) {\n    this.options = options\n  }\n \n  async get(key) {\n    // This could be stored anywhere, like durable storage\n    return cache.get(key)\n  }\n \n  async set(key, data, ctx) {\n    // This could be stored anywhere, like durable storage\n    cache.set(key, {\n      value: data,\n      lastModified: Date.now(),\n      tags: ctx.tags,\n    })\n  }\n \n  async revalidateTag(tag) {\n    // Iterate over all entries in the cache\n    for (let [key, value] of cache) {\n      // If the value's tags include the specified tag, delete this entry\n      if (value.tags.includes(tag)) {\n        cache.delete(key)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nUsing a custom cache handler will allow you to ensure consistency across all pods hosting your Next.js application. For instance, you can save the cached values anywhere, like Redis or AWS S3.\n\nGood to know:\n\nrevalidatePath is a convenience layer on top of cache tags. Calling revalidatePath will call the revalidateTag function with a special default tag for the provided page.\n\n\nBuild Cache\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js generates an ID during next build to identify which version of your application is being served. The same build should be used and boot up multiple containers.\nIf you are rebuilding for each stage of your environment, you will need to generate a consistent build ID to use between containers. Use the generateBuildId command in next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  generateBuildId: async () => {\n    // This could be anything, using the latest git hash\n    return process.env.GIT_HASH\n  },\n}\nVersion Skew\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js will automatically mitigate most instances of version skew and automatically reload the application to retrieve new assets when detected. For example, if there is a mismatch in the deploymentId, transitions between pages will perform a hard navigation versus using a prefetched value.\nWhen the application is reloaded, there may be a loss of application state if it's not designed to persist between page navigations. For example, using URL state or local storage would persist state after a page refresh. However, component state like useState would be lost in such navigations.\nVercel provides additional skew protection for Next.js applications to ensure assets and functions from the previous version are still available to older clients, even after the new version is deployed.\nYou can manually configure the deploymentId property in your next.config.js file to ensure each request uses either ?dpl query string or x-deployment-id header.\nStreaming and Suspense\n  \n    \n    \n  \nThe Next.js App Router supports streaming responses when self-hosting. If you are using Nginx or a similar proxy, you will need to configure it to disable buffering to enable streaming.For example, you can disable buffering in Nginx by setting X-Accel-Buffering to no:next.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/:path*{/}?',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'X-Accel-Buffering',\n            value: 'no',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_deploying_production-checklist.txt","text":"Production ChecklistBefore taking your Next.js application to production, there are some optimizations and patterns you should consider implementing for the best user experience, performance, and security.\nThis page provides best practices that you can use as a reference when building your application, before going to production, and after deployment - as well as the automatic Next.js optimizations you should be aware of.\nAutomatic optimizations\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThese Next.js optimizations are enabled by default and require no configuration:\n\nServer Components: Next.js uses Server Components by default. Server Components run on the server, and don't require JavaScript to render on the client. As such, they have no impact on the size of your client-side JavaScript bundles. You can then use Client Components as needed for interactivity.\nCode-splitting: Server Components enable automatic code-splitting by route segments. You may also consider lazy loading Client Components and third-party libraries, where appropriate.\nPrefetching: When a link to a new route enters the user's viewport, Next.js prefetches the route in background. This makes navigation to new routes almost instant. You can opt out of prefetching, where appropriate.\nStatic Rendering: Next.js statically renders Server and Client Components on the server at build time and caches the rendered result to improve your application's performance. You can opt into Dynamic Rendering for specific routes, where appropriate. \nCaching: Next.js caches data requests, the rendered result of Server and Client Components, static assets, and more, to reduce the number of network requests to your server, database, and backend services. You may opt out of caching, where appropriate.\n\n\nThese defaults aim to improve your application's performance, and reduce the cost and amount of data transferred on each network request.\nDuring development\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhile building your application, we recommend using the following features to ensure the best performance and user experience:\nRouting and rendering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nLayouts: Use layouts to share UI across pages and enable partial rendering on navigation.\n<Link> component: Use the <Link> component for client-side navigation and prefetching.\nError Handling: Gracefully handle catch-all errors and 404 errors in production by creating custom error pages.\nComposition Patterns: Follow the recommended composition patterns for Server and Client Components, and check the placement of your \"use client\" boundaries to avoid unnecessarily increasing your client-side JavaScript bundle.\nDynamic Functions: Be aware that dynamic functions like cookies() and the searchParams prop will opt the entire route into Dynamic Rendering (or your whole application if used in the Root Layout). Ensure dynamic function usage is intentional and wrap them in <Suspense> boundaries where appropriate.\n\nGood to know: Partial Prerendering (Experimental) will allow parts of a route to be dynamic without opting the whole route into dynamic rendering.\n\n\nData fetching and caching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nServer Components: Leverage the benefits of fetching data on the server using Server Components.\nRoute Handlers: Use Route Handlers to access your backend resources from Client Components. But do not call Route Handlers from Server Components to avoid an additional server request.\nStreaming: Use Loading UI and React Suspense to progressively send UI from the server to the client, and prevent the whole route from blocking while data is being fetched.\nParallel Data Fetching: Reduce network waterfalls by fetching data in parallel, where appropriate. Also, consider preloading data where appropriate.\nData Caching: Verify whether your data requests are being cached or not, and opt into caching, where appropriate. Ensure requests that don't use fetch are cached.\nStatic Images: Use the public directory to automatically cache your application's static assets, e.g. images.\n\n\nUI and accessibility\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nForms and Validation: Use Server Actions to handle form submissions, server-side validation, and handle errors.\n\n\nFont Module: Optimize fonts by using the Font Module, which automatically hosts your font files with other static assets, removes external network requests, and reduces layout shift.\n<Image> Component: Optimize images by using the Image Component, which automatically optimizes images, prevents layout shift, and serves them in modern formats like WebP or AVIF.\n<Script> Component: Optimize third-party scripts by using the Script Component, which automatically defers scripts and prevents them from blocking the main thread.\nESLint: Use the built-in eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y plugin to catch accessibility issues early.\n\nSecurity\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nTainting: Prevent sensitive data from being exposed to the client by tainting data objects and/or specific values.\nServer Actions: Ensure users are authorized to call Server Actions. Review the the recommended security practices.\n\n\nEnvironment Variables: Ensure your .env.* files are added to .gitignore and only public variables are prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_.\nContent Security Policy: Consider adding a Content Security Policy to protect your application against various security threats such as cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.\n\nMetadata and SEO\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nMetadata API: Use the Metadata API to improve your application's Search Engine Optimization (SEO) by adding page titles, descriptions, and more.\nOpen Graph (OG) images: Create OG images to prepare your application for social sharing.\nSitemaps and Robots: Help Search Engines crawl and index your pages by generating sitemaps and robots files.\n\n\nType safety\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nTypeScript and TS Plugin: Use TypeScript and the TypeScript plugin for better type-safety, and to help you catch errors early.\n\nBefore going to production\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBefore going to production, you can run next build to build your application locally and catch any build errors, then run next start to measure the performance of your application in a production-like environment.\nCore Web Vitals\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nLighthouse: Run lighthouse in incognito to gain a better understanding of how your users will experience your site, and to identify areas for improvement. This is a simulated test and should be paired with looking at field data (such as Core Web Vitals).\n\n\nuseReportWebVitals hook: Use this hook to send Core Web Vitals data to analytics tools.\n\nAnalyzing bundles\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUse the @next/bundle-analyzer plugin to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles and identify large modules and dependencies that might be impacting your application's performance.\nAdditionally, the following tools can you understand the impact of adding new dependencies to your application:\n\nImport Cost\nPackage Phobia\nBundle Phobia\nbundlejs\n\nAfter deployment\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDepending on where you deploy your application, you might have access to additional tools and integrations to help you monitor and improve your application's performance.\nFor Vercel deployments, we recommend the following:\n\nAnalytics: A built-in analytics dashboard to help you understand your application's traffic, including the number of unique visitors, page views, and more.\nSpeed Insights: Real-world performance insights based on visitor data, offering a practical view of how your website is performing in the field.\nLogging: Runtime and Activity logs to help you debug issues and monitor your application in production. Alternatively, see the integrations page for a list of third-party tools and services.\n\n\nGood to know:\nTo get a comprehensive understanding of the best practices for production deployments on Vercel, including detailed strategies for improving website performance, refer to the Vercel Production Checklist.\n\nFollowing these recommendations will help you build a faster, more reliable, and secure application for your users."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_deploying_static-exports.txt","text":"Static Exports\nNext.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server.\nWhen running next build, Next.js generates an HTML file per route. By breaking a strict SPA into individual HTML files, Next.js can avoid loading unnecessary JavaScript code on the client-side, reducing the bundle size and enabling faster page loads.\nSince Next.js supports this static export, it can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets.\n\nConfiguration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo enable a static export, change the output mode inside next.config.js:\nnext.config.js/**\n * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\n */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export',\n \n  // Optional: Change links `/me` -> `/me/` and emit `/me.html` -> `/me/index.html`\n  // trailingSlash: true,\n \n  // Optional: Prevent automatic `/me` -> `/me/`, instead preserve `href`\n  // skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true,\n \n  // Optional: Change the output directory `out` -> `dist`\n  // distDir: 'dist',\n}\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig\nAfter running next build, Next.js will produce an out folder which contains the HTML/CSS/JS assets for your application.\n\nSupported Features\n  \n    \n    \n  \nThe core of Next.js has been designed to support static exports.Server Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \nWhen you run next build to generate a static export, Server Components consumed inside the app directory will run during the build, similar to traditional static-site generation.The resulting component will be rendered into static HTML for the initial page load and a static payload for client navigation between routes. No changes are required for your Server Components when using the static export, unless they consume dynamic server functions.app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default async function Page() {\n  // This fetch will run on the server during `next build`\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  return <main>...</main>\n}Client Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \nIf you want to perform data fetching on the client, you can use a Client Component with SWR to memoize requests.app/other/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n \nconst fetcher = (url: string) => fetch(url).then((r) => r.json())\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const { data, error } = useSWR(\n    `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`,\n    fetcher\n  )\n  if (error) return 'Failed to load'\n  if (!data) return 'Loading...'\n \n  return data.title\n}Since route transitions happen client-side, this behaves like a traditional SPA. For example, the following index route allows you to navigate to different posts on the client:app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Index Page</h1>\n      <hr />\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <Link href=\"/post/1\">Post 1</Link>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <Link href=\"/post/2\">Post 2</Link>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nImage Optimization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nImage Optimization through next/image can be used with a static export by defining a custom image loader in next.config.js. For example, you can optimize images with a service like Cloudinary:\nnext.config.js/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export',\n  images: {\n    loader: 'custom',\n    loaderFile: './my-loader.ts',\n  },\n}\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig\nThis custom loader will define how to fetch images from a remote source. For example, the following loader will construct the URL for Cloudinary:\nmy-loader.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function cloudinaryLoader({\n  src,\n  width,\n  quality,\n}: {\n  src: string\n  width: number\n  quality?: number\n}) {\n  const params = ['f_auto', 'c_limit', `w_${width}`, `q_${quality || 'auto'}`]\n  return `https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/${params.join(\n    ','\n  )}${src}`\n}\n\nYou can then use next/image in your application, defining relative paths to the image in Cloudinary:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Image alt=\"turtles\" src=\"/turtles.jpg\" width={300} height={300} />\n}\n\nRoute Handlers\n  \n    \n    \n  \nRoute Handlers will render a static response when running next build. Only the GET HTTP verb is supported. This can be used to generate static HTML, JSON, TXT, or other files from cached or uncached data. For example:app/data.json/route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport async function GET() {\n  return Response.json({ name: 'Lee' })\n}The above file app/data.json/route.ts will render to a static file during next build, producing data.json containing { name: 'Lee' }.If you need to read dynamic values from the incoming request, you cannot use a static export.Browser APIs\n  \n    \n    \n  \nClient Components are pre-rendered to HTML during next build. Because Web APIs like window, localStorage, and navigator are not available on the server, you need to safely access these APIs only when running in the browser. For example:'use client';\n \nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\n \nexport default function ClientComponent() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // You now have access to `window`\n    console.log(window.innerHeight);\n  }, [])\n \n  return ...;\n}\nUnsupported Features\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFeatures that require a Node.js server, or dynamic logic that cannot be computed during the build process, are not supported:\n\nDynamic Routes with dynamicParams: true\nDynamic Routes without generateStaticParams()\nRoute Handlers that rely on Request\nCookies\nRewrites\nRedirects\nHeaders\nMiddleware\nIncremental Static Regeneration\nImage Optimization with the default loader\nDraft Mode\nAttempting to use any of these features with next dev will result in an error, similar to setting the dynamic option to error in the root layout.export const dynamic = 'error'\n\nDeploying\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWith a static export, Next.js can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets.\nWhen running next build, Next.js generates the static export into the out folder. For example, let's say you have the following routes:\n\n/\n/blog/[id]\n\nAfter running next build, Next.js will generate the following files:\n\n/out/index.html\n/out/404.html\n/out/blog/post-1.html\n/out/blog/post-2.html\n\nIf you are using a static host like Nginx, you can configure rewrites from incoming requests to the correct files:\nnginx.confserver {\n  listen 80;\n  server_name acme.com;\n \n  root /var/www/out;\n \n  location / {\n      try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;\n  }\n \n  # This is necessary when `trailingSlash: false`.\n  # You can omit this when `trailingSlash: true`.\n  location /blog/ {\n      rewrite ^/blog/(.*)$ /blog/$1.html break;\n  }\n \n  error_page 404 /404.html;\n  location = /404.html {\n      internal;\n  }\n}\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv14.0.0next export has been removed in favor of \"output\": \"export\"v13.4.0App Router (Stable) adds enhanced static export support, including using React Server Components and Route Handlers.v13.3.0next export is deprecated and replaced with \"output\": \"export\""},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_optimizing.txt","text":"Optimizations\nNext.js comes with a variety of built-in optimizations designed to improve your application's speed and Core Web Vitals.

This reduces the size of the font file and improves performance. You'll need to define which of these subsets you want to preload. Failing to specify any subsets while preload is true will result in a warning.\nThis can be done by adding it to the function call:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n\nView the Font API Reference for more information.\nUsing Multiple Fonts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can import and use multiple fonts in your application. There are two approaches you can take.\nThe first approach is to create a utility function that exports a font, imports it, and applies its className where needed. This ensures the font is preloaded only when it's rendered:\napp/fonts.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n \nexport const inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nexport const roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { inter } from './fonts'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={inter.className}>\n      <body>\n        <div>{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { roboto_mono } from './fonts'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1 className={roboto_mono.className}>My page</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\nIn the example above, Inter will be applied globally, and Roboto Mono can be imported and applied as needed.\nAlternatively, you can create a CSS variable and use it with your preferred CSS solution:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\nimport styles from './global.css'\n \nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nconst roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-roboto-mono',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={`${inter.variable} ${roboto_mono.variable}`}>\n      <body>\n        <h1>My App</h1>\n        <div>{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\napp/global.csshtml {\n  font-family: var(--font-inter);\n}\n \nh1 {\n  font-family: var(--font-roboto-mono);\n}\nIn the example above, Inter will be applied globally, and any <h1> tags will be styled with Roboto Mono.\n\nRecommendation: Use multiple fonts conservatively since each new font is an additional resource the client has to download.\n\nLocal Fonts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nImport next/font/local and specify the src of your local font file.

Load your font with the variable option to define your CSS variable name and assign it to inter. Then, use inter.variable to add the CSS variable to your HTML document.\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n \nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n \nconst roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n  variable: '--font-roboto-mono',\n})\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={`${inter.variable} ${roboto_mono.variable}`}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nFinally, add the CSS variable to your Tailwind CSS config:\ntailwind.config.js/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontFamily: {\n        sans: ['var(--font-inter)'],\n        mono: ['var(--font-roboto-mono)'],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\nYou can now use the font-sans and font-mono utility classes to apply the font to your elements.\nPreloading\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen a font function is called on a page of your site, it is not globally available and preloaded on all routes. Rather, the font is only preloaded on the related routes based on the type of file where it is used:\nIf it's a unique page, it is preloaded on the unique route for that page.\nIf it's a layout, it is preloaded on all the routes wrapped by the layout.\nIf it's the root layout, it is preloaded on all routes.\n\n\nReusing fonts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nEvery time you call the localFont or Google font function, that font is hosted as one instance in your application. Therefore, if you load the same font function in multiple files, multiple instances of the same font are hosted. In this situation, it is recommended to do the following:\n\nCall the font loader function in one shared file\nExport it as a constant\nImport the constant in each file where you would like to use this font\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_optimizing_images.txt","text":"Image Optimization\nExamples\nImage Component\n\nAccording to Web Almanac, images account for a huge portion of the typical website’s page weight and can have a sizable impact on your website's LCP performance.\nThe Next.js Image component extends the HTML <img> element with features for automatic image optimization:\n\nSize Optimization: Automatically serve correctly sized images for each device, using modern image formats like WebP and AVIF.\nVisual Stability: Prevent layout shift automatically when images are loading.\nFaster Page Loads: Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport using native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.\nAsset Flexibility: On-demand image resizing, even for images stored on remote servers\n\n\n🎥 Watch: Learn more about how to use next/image → YouTube (9 minutes).\n\nUsage\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nYou can then define the src for your image (either local or remote).\nLocal Images\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo use a local image, import your .jpg, .png, or .webp image files.\nNext.js will automatically determine the width and height of your image based on the imported file. These values are used to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift while your image is loading.\napp/page.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport profilePic from './me.png'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={profilePic}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      // width={500} automatically provided\n      // height={500} automatically provided\n      // blurDataURL=\"data:...\" automatically provided\n      // placeholder=\"blur\" // Optional blur-up while loading\n    />\n  )\n}\n\n\nWarning: Dynamic await import() or require() are not supported. The import must be static so it can be analyzed at build time.\n\nRemote Images\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo use a remote image, the src property should be a URL string.\nSince Next.js does not have access to remote files during the build process, you'll need to provide the width, height and optional blurDataURL props manually.\nThe width and height attributes are used to infer the correct aspect ratio of image and avoid layout shift from the image loading in. The width and height do not determine the rendered size of the image file. Learn more about Image Sizing.\napp/page.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\nTo safely allow optimizing images, define a list of supported URL patterns in next.config.js. Be as specific as possible to prevent malicious usage. For example, the following configuration will only allow images from a specific AWS S3 bucket:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 's3.amazonaws.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/my-bucket/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\nLearn more about remotePatterns configuration. If you want to use relative URLs for the image src, use a loader.\nDomains\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSometimes you may want to optimize a remote image, but still use the built-in Next.js Image Optimization API. To do this, leave the loader at its default setting and enter an absolute URL for the Image src prop.\nTo protect your application from malicious users, you must define a list of remote hostnames you intend to use with the next/image component.\n\nLearn more about remotePatterns configuration.\n\nLoaders\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNote that in the example earlier, a partial URL (\"/me.png\") is provided for a local image. This is possible because of the loader architecture.\nA loader is a function that generates the URLs for your image. It modifies the provided src, and generates multiple URLs to request the image at different sizes. These multiple URLs are used in the automatic srcset generation, so that visitors to your site will be served an image that is the right size for their viewport.\nThe default loader for Next.js applications uses the built-in Image Optimization API, which optimizes images from anywhere on the web, and then serves them directly from the Next.js web server. If you would like to serve your images directly from a CDN or image server, you can write your own loader function with a few lines of JavaScript.\nYou can define a loader per-image with the loader prop, or at the application level with the loaderFile configuration.\nPriority\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou should add the priority property to the image that will be the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element for each page. Doing so allows Next.js to specially prioritize the image for loading (e.g. through preload tags or priority hints), leading to a meaningful boost in LCP.\nThe LCP element is typically the largest image or text block visible within the viewport of the page. When you run next dev, you'll see a console warning if the LCP element is an <Image> without the priority property.\nOnce you've identified the LCP image, you can add the property like this:\n\napp/page.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport profilePic from '../public/me.png'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Image src={profilePic} alt=\"Picture of the author\" priority />\n}\nSee more about priority in the next/image component documentation.\nImage Sizing\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOne of the ways that images most commonly hurt performance is through layout shift, where the image pushes other elements around on the page as it loads in. This performance problem is so annoying to users that it has its own Core Web Vital, called Cumulative Layout Shift. The way to avoid image-based layout shifts is to always size your images. This allows the browser to reserve precisely enough space for the image before it loads.\nBecause next/image is designed to guarantee good performance results, it cannot be used in a way that will contribute to layout shift, and must be sized in one of three ways:\n\nAutomatically, using a static import\nExplicitly, by including a width and height property\nImplicitly, by using fill which causes the image to expand to fill its parent element.\n\n\nWhat if I don't know the size of my images?\nIf you are accessing images from a source without knowledge of the images' sizes, there are several things you can do:\nUse fill\nThe fill prop allows your image to be sized by its parent element. Consider using CSS to give the image's parent element space on the page along sizes prop to match any media query break points. You can also use object-fit with fill, contain, or cover, and object-position to define how the image should occupy that space.\nNormalize your images\nIf you're serving images from a source that you control, consider modifying your image pipeline to normalize the images to a specific size.\nModify your API calls\nIf your application is retrieving image URLs using an API call (such as to a CMS), you may be able to modify the API call to return the image dimensions along with the URL.\n\nIf none of the suggested methods works for sizing your images, the next/image component is designed to work well on a page alongside standard <img> elements.\nStyling\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nStyling the Image component is similar to styling a normal <img> element, but there are a few guidelines to keep in mind:\n\nUse className or style, not styled-jsx.\n\nIn most cases, we recommend using the className prop. This can be an imported CSS Module, a global stylesheet, etc.\nYou can also use the style prop to assign inline styles.\nYou cannot use styled-jsx because it's scoped to the current component (unless you mark the style as global).\n\n\nWhen using fill, the parent element must have position: relative\n\nThis is necessary for the proper rendering of the image element in that layout mode.\n\n\nWhen using fill, the parent element must have display: block\n\nThis is the default for <div> elements but should be specified otherwise.\n\n\n\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nResponsive\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Responsive() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n      <Image\n        alt=\"Mountains\"\n        // Importing an image will\n        // automatically set the width and height\n        src={mountains}\n        sizes=\"100vw\"\n        // Make the image display full width\n        style={{\n          width: '100%',\n          height: 'auto',\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nFill Container\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Fill() {\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{\n        display: 'grid',\n        gridGap: '8px',\n        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, auto))',\n      }}\n    >\n      <div style={{ position: 'relative', height: '400px' }}>\n        <Image\n          alt=\"Mountains\"\n          src={mountains}\n          fill\n          sizes=\"(min-width: 808px) 50vw, 100vw\"\n          style={{\n            objectFit: 'cover', // cover, contain, none\n          }}\n        />\n      </div>\n      {/* And more images in the grid... */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nBackground Image\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Background() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      alt=\"Mountains\"\n      src={mountains}\n      placeholder=\"blur\"\n      quality={100}\n      fill\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        objectFit: 'cover',\n      }}\n    />\n  )\n}\nFor examples of the Image component used with the various styles, see the Image Component Demo.\nOther Properties\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nView all properties available to the next/image component.\nConfiguration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe next/image component and Next.js Image Optimization API can be configured in the next.config.js file.

You can also create dynamic OG images using the ImageResponse constructor.\nStatic Metadata\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo define static metadata, export a Metadata object from a layout.js or static page.js file.\nlayout.tsx | page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: '...',\n  description: '...',\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {}\n\nFor all the available options, see the API Reference.\nDynamic Metadata\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use generateMetadata function to fetch metadata that requires dynamic values.\napp/products/[id]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { Metadata, ResolvingMetadata } from 'next'\n \ntype Props = {\n  params: { id: string }\n  searchParams: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }\n}\n \nexport async function generateMetadata(\n  { params, searchParams }: Props,\n  parent: ResolvingMetadata\n): Promise<Metadata> {\n  // read route params\n  const id = params.id\n \n  // fetch data\n  const product = await fetch(`https://.../${id}`).then((res) => res.json())\n \n  // optionally access and extend (rather than replace) parent metadata\n  const previousImages = (await parent).openGraph?.images || []\n \n  return {\n    title: product.title,\n    openGraph: {\n      images: ['/some-specific-page-image.jpg', ...previousImages],\n    },\n  }\n}\n \nexport default function Page({ params, searchParams }: Props) {}\n\nFor all the available params, see the API Reference.\n\nGood to know:\n\nBoth static and dynamic metadata through generateMetadata are only supported in Server Components.\nfetch requests are automatically memoized for the same data across generateMetadata, generateStaticParams, Layouts, Pages, and Server Components. React cache can be used if fetch is unavailable.\nNext.js will wait for data fetching inside generateMetadata to complete before streaming UI to the client. This guarantees the first part of a streamed response includes <head> tags.\n\n\nFile-based metadata\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThese special files are available for metadata:\n\nfavicon.ico, apple-icon.jpg, and icon.jpg\nopengraph-image.jpg and twitter-image.jpg\nrobots.txt\nsitemap.xml\n\nYou can use these for static metadata, or you can programmatically generate these files with code.\nFor implementation and examples, see the Metadata Files API Reference and Dynamic Image Generation.\nBehavior\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFile-based metadata has the higher priority and will override any config-based metadata.\nDefault Fields\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are two default meta tags that are always added even if a route doesn't define metadata:\n\nThe meta charset tag sets the character encoding for the website.\nThe meta viewport tag sets the viewport width and scale for the website to adjust for different devices.\n\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\nGood to know: You can overwrite the default viewport meta tag.\n\nOrdering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMetadata is evaluated in order, starting from the root segment down to the segment closest to the final page.js segment. For example:\n\napp/layout.tsx (Root Layout)\napp/blog/layout.tsx (Nested Blog Layout)\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (Blog Page)\n\nMerging\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFollowing the evaluation order, Metadata objects exported from multiple segments in the same route are shallowly merged together to form the final metadata output of a route. Duplicate keys are replaced based on their ordering.\nThis means metadata with nested fields such as openGraph and robots that are defined in an earlier segment are overwritten by the last segment to define them.\nOverwriting fields\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\napp/layout.jsexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Acme',\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Acme',\n    description: 'Acme is a...',\n  },\n}\napp/blog/page.jsexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Blog',\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Blog',\n  },\n}\n \n// Output:\n// <title>Blog</title>\n// <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Blog\" />\nIn the example above:\n\ntitle from app/layout.js is replaced by title in app/blog/page.js.\nAll openGraph fields from app/layout.js are replaced in app/blog/page.js because app/blog/page.js sets openGraph metadata. Note the absence of openGraph.description.\n\nIf you'd like to share some nested fields between segments while overwriting others, you can pull them out into a separate variable:\napp/shared-metadata.jsexport const openGraphImage = { images: ['http://...'] }\napp/page.jsimport { openGraphImage } from './shared-metadata'\n \nexport const metadata = {\n  openGraph: {\n    ...openGraphImage,\n    title: 'Home',\n  },\n}\napp/about/page.jsimport { openGraphImage } from '../shared-metadata'\n \nexport const metadata = {\n  openGraph: {\n    ...openGraphImage,\n    title: 'About',\n  },\n}\nIn the example above, the OG image is shared between app/layout.js and app/about/page.js while the titles are different.\nInheriting fields\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\napp/layout.jsexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Acme',\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Acme',\n    description: 'Acme is a...',\n  },\n}\napp/about/page.jsexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'About',\n}\n \n// Output:\n// <title>About</title>\n// <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Acme\" />\n// <meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Acme is a...\" />\nNotes\n\ntitle from app/layout.js is replaced by title in app/about/page.js.\nAll openGraph fields from app/layout.js are inherited in app/about/page.js because app/about/page.js doesn't set openGraph metadata.\n\nDynamic Image Generation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe ImageResponse constructor allows you to generate dynamic images using JSX and CSS. This is useful for creating social media images such as Open Graph images, Twitter cards, and more.\nImageResponse uses the Edge Runtime, and Next.js automatically adds the correct headers to cached images at the edge, helping improve performance and reducing recomputation.\nTo use it, you can import ImageResponse from next/og:\napp/about/route.jsimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\n \nexport const runtime = 'edge'\n \nexport async function GET() {\n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          fontSize: 128,\n          background: 'white',\n          width: '100%',\n          height: '100%',\n          display: 'flex',\n          textAlign: 'center',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        Hello world!\n      </div>\n    ),\n    {\n      width: 1200,\n      height: 600,\n    }\n  )\n}\nImageResponse integrates well with other Next.js APIs, including Route Handlers and file-based Metadata. For example, you can use ImageResponse in a opengraph-image.tsx file to generate Open Graph images at build time or dynamically at request time.\nImageResponse supports common CSS properties including flexbox and absolute positioning, custom fonts, text wrapping, centering, and nested images. See the full list of supported CSS properties.\n\nGood to know:\n\nExamples are available in the Vercel OG Playground.\nImageResponse uses @vercel/og, Satori, and Resvg to convert HTML and CSS into PNG.\nOnly the Edge Runtime is supported. The default Node.js runtime will not work.\nOnly flexbox and a subset of CSS properties are supported. Advanced layouts (e.g. display: grid) will not work.\nMaximum bundle size of 500KB. The bundle size includes your JSX, CSS, fonts, images, and any other assets. If you exceed the limit, consider reducing the size of any assets or fetching at runtime.\nOnly ttf, otf, and woff font formats are supported. To maximize the font parsing speed, ttf or otf are preferred over woff.\n\n\nJSON-LD\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nJSON-LD is a format for structured data that can be used by search engines to understand your content. For example, you can use it to describe a person, an event, an organization, a movie, a book, a recipe, and many other types of entities.\nOur current recommendation for JSON-LD is to render structured data as a <script> tag in your layout.js or page.js components. For example:\napp/products/[id]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default async function Page({ params }) {\n  const product = await getProduct(params.id)\n \n  const jsonLd = {\n    '@context': 'https://schema.org',\n    '@type': 'Product',\n    name: product.name,\n    image: product.image,\n    description: product.description,\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <section>\n      {/* Add JSON-LD to your page */}\n      <script\n        type=\"application/ld+json\"\n        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(jsonLd) }}\n      />\n      {/* ... */}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nYou can validate and test your structured data with the Rich Results Test for Google or the generic Schema Markup Validator.\nYou can type your JSON-LD with TypeScript using community packages like schema-dts:\nimport { Product, WithContext } from 'schema-dts'\n \nconst jsonLd: WithContext<Product> = {\n  '@context': 'https://schema.org',\n  '@type': 'Product',\n  name: 'Next.js Sticker',\n  image: 'https://nextjs.org/imgs/sticker.png',\n  description: 'Dynamic at the speed of static.',\n}"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_optimizing_open-telemetry.txt","text":"OpenTelemetry\n\nGood to know: This feature is experimental, you need to explicitly opt-in by providing experimental.instrumentationHook = true; in your next.config.js.\n\nObservability is crucial for understanding and optimizing the behavior and performance of your Next.js app.\nAs applications become more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and diagnose issues that may arise. By leveraging observability tools, such as logging and metrics, developers can gain insights into their application's behavior and identify areas for optimization. With observability, developers can proactively address issues before they become major problems and provide a better user experience. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use observability in your Next.js applications to improve performance, optimize resources, and enhance user experience.\nWe recommend using OpenTelemetry for instrumenting your apps.\nIt's a platform-agnostic way to instrument apps that allows you to change your observability provider without changing your code.\nRead Official OpenTelemetry docs for more information about OpenTelemetry and how it works.\nThis documentation uses terms like Span, Trace or Exporter throughout this doc, all of which can be found in the OpenTelemetry Observability Primer.\nNext.js supports OpenTelemetry instrumentation out of the box, which means that we already instrumented Next.js itself.\nWhen you enable OpenTelemetry we will automatically wrap all your code like getStaticProps in spans with helpful attributes.\nGetting Started\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOpenTelemetry is extensible but setting it up properly can be quite verbose.\nThat's why we prepared a package @vercel/otel that helps you get started quickly.\nUsing @vercel/otel\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo get started, you must install @vercel/otel:\nTerminalnpm install @vercel/otel\nNext, create a custom instrumentation.ts (or .js) file in the root directory of the project (or inside src folder if using one):\n\nyour-project/instrumentation.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'\n \nexport function register() {\n  registerOTel({ serviceName: 'next-app' })\n}\n\nSee the @vercel/otel documentation for additional configuration options.\n\nGood to know\n\nThe instrumentation file should be in the root of your project and not inside the app or pages directory. If you're using the src folder, then place the file inside src alongside pages and app.\nIf you use the pageExtensions config option to add a suffix, you will also need to update the instrumentation filename to match.\nWe have created a basic with-opentelemetry example that you can use.\n\n\n\nManual OpenTelemetry configuration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe @vercel/otel package provides many configuration options and should serve most of common use cases. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can configure OpenTelemetry manually.\nFirstly you need to install OpenTelemetry packages:\nTerminalnpm install @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http\nNow you can initialize NodeSDK in your instrumentation.ts.\nUnlike @vercel/otel, NodeSDK is not compatible with edge runtime, so you need to make sure that you are importing them only when process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs'. We recommend creating a new file instrumentation.node.ts which you conditionally import only when using node:\ninstrumentation.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport async function register() {\n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {\n    await import('./instrumentation.node.ts')\n  }\n}\n\ninstrumentation.node.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node'\nimport { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http'\nimport { Resource } from '@opentelemetry/resources'\nimport { SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME } from '@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions'\nimport { SimpleSpanProcessor } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node'\n \nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\n  resource: new Resource({\n    [SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME]: 'next-app',\n  }),\n  spanProcessor: new SimpleSpanProcessor(new OTLPTraceExporter()),\n})\nsdk.start()\n\nDoing this is equivalent to using @vercel/otel, but it's possible to modify and extend some features that are not exposed by the @vercel/otel. If edge runtime support is necessary, you will have to use @vercel/otel.\nTesting your instrumentation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou need an OpenTelemetry collector with a compatible backend to test OpenTelemetry traces locally.\nWe recommend using our OpenTelemetry dev environment.\nIf everything works well you should be able to see the root server span labeled as GET /requested/pathname.\nAll other spans from that particular trace will be nested under it.\nNext.js traces more spans than are emitted by default.\nTo see more spans, you must set NEXT_OTEL_VERBOSE=1.\nDeployment\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUsing OpenTelemetry Collector\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen you are deploying with OpenTelemetry Collector, you can use @vercel/otel.\nIt will work both on Vercel and when self-hosted.\nDeploying on Vercel\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWe made sure that OpenTelemetry works out of the box on Vercel.\nFollow Vercel documentation to connect your project to an observability provider.\nSelf-hosting\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDeploying to other platforms is also straightforward. You will need to spin up your own OpenTelemetry Collector to receive and process the telemetry data from your Next.js app.\nTo do this, follow the OpenTelemetry Collector Getting Started guide, which will walk you through setting up the collector and configuring it to receive data from your Next.js app.\nOnce you have your collector up and running, you can deploy your Next.js app to your chosen platform following their respective deployment guides.\nCustom Exporters\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOpenTelemetry Collector is not necessary. You can use a custom OpenTelemetry exporter with @vercel/otel or manual OpenTelemetry configuration.\nCustom Spans\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can add a custom span with OpenTelemetry APIs.\nTerminalnpm install @opentelemetry/api\nThe following example demonstrates a function that fetches GitHub stars and adds a custom fetchGithubStars span to track the fetch request's result:\nimport { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api'\n \nexport async function fetchGithubStars() {\n  return await trace\n    .getTracer('nextjs-example')\n    .startActiveSpan('fetchGithubStars', async (span) => {\n      try {\n        return await getValue()\n      } finally {\n        span.end()\n      }\n    })\n}\nThe register function will execute before your code runs in a new environment.\nYou can start creating new spans, and they should be correctly added to the exported trace.\nDefault Spans in Next.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js automatically instruments several spans for you to provide useful insights into your application's performance.\nAttributes on spans follow OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. We also add some custom attributes under the next namespace:\n\nnext.span_name - duplicates span name\nnext.span_type - each span type has a unique identifier\nnext.route - The route pattern of the request (e.g., /[param]/user).\nnext.rsc (true/false) - Whether the request is an RSC request, such as prefetch.\nnext.page\n\nThis is an internal value used by an app router.\nYou can think about it as a route to a special file (like page.ts, layout.ts, loading.ts and others)\nIt can be used as a unique identifier only when paired with next.route because /layout can be used to identify both /(groupA)/layout.ts and /(groupB)/layout.ts\n\n\n\n[http.method] [next.route]\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nnext.span_type: BaseServer.handleRequest\n\nThis span represents the root span for each incoming request to your Next.js application. It tracks the HTTP method, route, target, and status code of the request.\nAttributes:\n\nCommon HTTP attributes\n\nhttp.method\nhttp.status_code\n\n\nServer HTTP attributes\n\nhttp.route\nhttp.target\n\n\nnext.span_name\nnext.span_type\nnext.route\n\nrender route (app) [next.route]\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nnext.span_type: AppRender.getBodyResult.\n\nThis span represents the process of rendering a route in the app router.\nAttributes:\n\nnext.span_name\nnext.span_type\nnext.route\n\nfetch [http.method] [http.url]\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nnext.span_type: AppRender.fetch\n\nThis span represents the fetch request executed in your code.\nAttributes:\n\nCommon HTTP attributes\n\nhttp.method\n\n\nClient HTTP attributes\n\nhttp.url\nnet.peer.name\nnet.peer.port (only if specified)\n\n\nnext.span_name\nnext.span_type\n\nThis span can be turned off by setting NEXT_OTEL_FETCH_DISABLED=1 in your environment.

This integration method within Next.js allows for customization and control of your video content.\nUsing video hosting services (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.): For video hosting services like YouTube or Vimeo, you'll embed their iframe-based players using the <iframe> tag. While this method limits some control over the player, it offers ease of use and features provided by these platforms.\n\nChoose the embedding method that aligns with your application's requirements and the user experience you aim to deliver.\nEmbedding externally hosted videos\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo embed videos from external platforms, you can use Next.js to fetch the video information and React Suspense to handle the fallback state while loading.\n1. Create a Server Component for video embedding\nThe first step is to create a Server Component that generates the appropriate iframe for embedding the video. This component will fetch the source URL for the video and render the iframe.\napp/ui/video-component.jsxexport default async function VideoComponent() {\n  const src = await getVideoSrc()\n \n  return <iframe src={src} frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen />\n}\n2. Stream the video component using React Suspense\nAfter creating the Server Component to embed the video, the next step is to stream the component using React Suspense.\napp/page.jsximport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport VideoComponent from '../ui/VideoComponent.jsx'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading video...</p>}>\n        <VideoComponent />\n      </Suspense>\n      {/* Other content of the page */}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know: When embedding videos from external platforms, consider the following best practices:\n\nEnsure the video embeds are responsive. Use CSS to make the iframe or video player adapt to different screen sizes.\nImplement strategies for loading videos based on network conditions, especially for users with limited data plans.\n\n\nThis approach results in a better user experience as it prevents the page from blocking, meaning the user can interact with the page while the video component streams in.\nFor a more engaging and informative loading experience, consider using a loading skeleton as the fallback UI. So instead of showing a simple loading message, you can show a skeleton that resembles the video player like this:\napp/page.jsximport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport VideoComponent from '../ui/VideoComponent.jsx'\nimport VideoSkeleton from '../ui/VideoSkeleton.jsx'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<VideoSkeleton />}>\n        <VideoComponent />\n      </Suspense>\n      {/* Other content of the page */}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\nSelf-hosted videos\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSelf-hosting videos may be preferable for several reasons:\n\nComplete control and independence: Self-hosting gives you direct management over your video content, from playback to appearance, ensuring full ownership and control, free from external platform constraints.\nCustomization for specific needs: Ideal for unique requirements, like dynamic background videos, it allows for tailored customization to align with design and functional needs.\nPerformance and scalability considerations: Choose storage solutions that are both high-performing and scalable, to support increasing traffic and content size effectively.\nCost and integration: Balance the costs of storage and bandwidth with the need for easy integration into your Next.js framework and broader tech ecosystem.\n\nUsing Vercel Blob for video hosting\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVercel Blob offers an efficient way to host videos, providing a scalable cloud storage solution that works well with Next.js. Here's how you can host a video using Vercel Blob:\n1. Uploading a video to Vercel Blob\nIn your Vercel dashboard, navigate to the \"Storage\" tab and select your Vercel Blob store. In the Blob table's upper-right corner, find and click the \"Upload\" button. Then, choose the video file you wish to upload. After the upload completes, the video file will appear in the Blob table.\nAlternatively, you can upload your video using a server action. For detailed instructions, refer to the Vercel documentation on server-side uploads. Vercel also supports client-side uploads. This method may be preferable for certain use cases.\n2. Displaying the video in Next.js\nOnce the video is uploaded and stored, you can display it in your Next.js application. Here's an example of how to do this using the <video> tag and React Suspense:\napp/page.jsximport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { list } from '@vercel/blob'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading video...</p>}>\n      <VideoComponent fileName=\"my-video.mp4\" />\n    </Suspense>\n  )\n}\n \nasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\n  const { blobs } = await list({\n    prefix: fileName,\n    limit: 1,\n  })\n  const { url } = blobs[0]\n \n  return (\n    <video controls preload=\"none\" aria-label=\"Video player\">\n      <source src={url} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n      Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n  )\n}\nIn this approach, the page uses the video's @vercel/blob URL to display the video using the VideoComponent. React Suspense is used to show a fallback until the video URL is fetched and the video is ready to be displayed.\nAdding subtitles to your video\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you have subtitles for your video, you can easily add them using the <track> element inside your <video> tag. You can fetch the subtitle file from Vercel Blob in a similar way as the video file. Here's how you can update the <VideoComponent> to include subtitles.\napp/page.jsxasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\n  const {blobs} = await list({\n    prefix: fileName,\n    limit: 2\n  });\n  const { url } = blobs[0];\n  const { url: captionsUrl } = blobs[1];\n \n  return (\n    <video controls preload=\"none\" aria-label=\"Video player\">\n      <source src={url} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n      <track\n        src={captionsUrl}\n        kind=\"subtitles\"\n        srcLang=\"en\"\n        label=\"English\">\n      Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n  );\n};\nBy following this approach, you can effectively self-host and integrate videos into your Next.js applications.\nResources\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo continue learning more about video optimization and best practices, please refer to the following resources:\n\nUnderstanding video formats and codecs: Choose the right format and codec, like MP4 for compatibility or WebM for web optimization, for your video needs.

React and Next.js allow you to create hybrid web applications where parts of your code can be rendered on the server or the client. This section will help you understand the differences between these rendering environments, strategies, and runtimes.\nFundamentals\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo start, it's helpful to be familiar with three foundational web concepts:\n\nThe Environments your application code can be executed in: the server and the client.\nThe Request-Response Lifecycle that's initiated when a user visits or interacts with your application.\nThe Network Boundary that separates server and client code.\n\nRendering Environments\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are two environments where web applications can be rendered: the client and the server.\n\n\nThe client refers to the browser on a user's device that sends a request to a server for your application code. It then turns the response from the server into a user interface.\nThe server refers to the computer in a data center that stores your application code, receives requests from a client, and sends back an appropriate response.\n\nHistorically, developers had to use different languages (e.g. JavaScript, PHP) and frameworks when writing code for the server and the client. With React, developers can use the same language (JavaScript), and the same framework (e.g. Next.js or your framework of choice). This flexibility allows you to seamlessly write code for both environments without context switching.\nHowever, each environment has its own set of capabilities and constraints. Therefore, the code you write for the server and the client is not always the same. There are certain operations (e.g. data fetching or managing user state) that are better suited for one environment over the other.\nUnderstanding these differences is key to effectively using React and Next.js. We'll cover the differences and use cases in more detail on the Server and Client Components pages, for now, let's continue building on our foundation.\nRequest-Response Lifecycle\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBroadly speaking, all websites follow the same Request-Response Lifecycle:\n\nUser Action: The user interacts with a web application. This could be clicking a link, submitting a form, or typing a URL directly into the browser's address bar.\nHTTP Request: The client sends an HTTP request to the server that contains necessary information about what resources are being requested, what method is being used (e.g. GET, POST), and additional data if necessary.\nServer: The server processes the request and responds with the appropriate resources. This process may take a couple of steps like routing, fetching data, etc.\nHTTP Response: After processing the request, the server sends an HTTP response back to the client. This response contains a status code (which tells the client whether the request was successful or not) and requested resources (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, static assets, etc).\nClient: The client parses the resources to render the user interface.\nUser Action: Once the user interface is rendered, the user can interact with it, and the whole process starts again.\n\nA major part of building a hybrid web application is deciding how to split the work in the lifecycle, and where to place the Network Boundary.\nNetwork Boundary\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn web development, the Network Boundary is a conceptual line that separates the different environments. For example, the client and the server, or the server and the data store.\n\nIn React, you choose where to place the client-server network boundary wherever it makes the most sense.\nBehind the scenes, the work is split into two parts: the client module graph and the server module graph. The server module graph contains all the components that are rendered on the server, and the client module graph contains all components that are rendered on the client.\n\nIt may be helpful to think about module graphs as a visual representation of how files in your application depend on each other.\n\nYou can use the React \"use client\" convention to define the boundary. There's also a \"use server\" convention, which tells React to do some computational work on the server.\nBuilding Hybrid Applications\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen working in these environments, it's helpful to think of the flow of the code in your application as unidirectional. In other words, during a response, your application code flows in one direction: from the server to the client.\n\nIf you need to access the server from the client, you send a new request to the server rather than re-use the same request. This makes it easier to understand where to render your components and where to place the Network Boundary.\nIn practice, this model encourages developers to think about what they want to execute on the server first, before sending the result to the client and making the application interactive.\nThis concept will become clearer when we look at how you can interleave client and server components in the same component tree."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_rendering_client-components.txt","text":"Client ComponentsClient Components allow you to write interactive UI that is prerendered on the server and can use client JavaScript to run in the browser.\nThis page will go through how Client Components work, how they're rendered, and when you might use them.\nBenefits of Client Rendering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the client, including:\n\nInteractivity: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI.\nBrowser APIs: Client Components have access to browser APIs, like geolocation or localStorage.\n\nUsing Client Components in Next.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo use Client Components, you can add the React \"use client\" directive at the top of a file, above your imports.\n\"use client\" is used to declare a boundary between a Server and Client Component modules. This means that by defining a \"use client\" in a file, all other modules imported into it, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle.\napp/counter.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useState } from 'react'\n \nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nThe diagram below shows that using onClick and useState in a nested component (toggle.js) will cause an error if the \"use client\" directive is not defined. This is because, by default, all components in the App Router are Server Components where these APIs are not available. By defining the \"use client\" directive in toggle.js, you can tell React to enter the client boundary where these APIs are available.\n\n\nDefining multiple use client entry points:\nYou can define multiple \"use client\" entry points in your React Component tree. This allows you to split your application into multiple client bundles.\nHowever, \"use client\" doesn't need to be defined in every component that needs to be rendered on the client. Once you define the boundary, all child components and modules imported into it are considered part of the client bundle.\n\nHow are Client Components Rendered?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn Next.js, Client Components are rendered differently depending on whether the request is part of a full page load (an initial visit to your application or a page reload triggered by a browser refresh) or a subsequent navigation.\nFull page load\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo optimize the initial page load, Next.js will use React's APIs to render a static HTML preview on the server for both Client and Server Components. This means, when the user first visits your application, they will see the content of the page immediately, without having to wait for the client to download, parse, and execute the Client Component JavaScript bundle.\nOn the server:\n\nReact renders Server Components into a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload), which includes references to Client Components.\nNext.js uses the RSC Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render HTML for the route on the server.\n\nThen, on the client:\n\nThe HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive initial preview of the route.\nThe React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\nThe JavaScript instructions are used to hydrate Client Components and make their UI interactive.\n\n\nWhat is hydration?\nHydration is the process of attaching event listeners to the DOM, to make the static HTML interactive. Behind the scenes, hydration is done with the hydrateRoot React API.\n\nSubsequent Navigations\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOn subsequent navigations, Client Components are rendered entirely on the client, without the server-rendered HTML.\nThis means the Client Component JavaScript bundle is downloaded and parsed. Once the bundle is ready, React will use the RSC Payload to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\nGoing back to the Server Environment\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSometimes, after you've declared the \"use client\" boundary, you may want to go back to the server environment. For example, you may want to reduce the client bundle size, fetch data on the server, or use an API that is only available on the server.\nYou can keep code on the server even though it's theoretically nested inside Client Components by interleaving Client and Server Components and Server Actions. See the Composition Patterns page for more information."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_rendering_composition-patterns.txt","text":"Server and Client Composition PatternsWhen building React applications, you will need to consider what parts of your application should be rendered on the server or the client. This page covers some recommended composition patterns when using Server and Client Components.\nWhen to use Server and Client Components?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nHere's a quick summary of the different use cases for Server and Client Components:\nWhat do you need to do?Server ComponentClient ComponentFetch dataAccess backend resources (directly)Keep sensitive information on the server (access tokens, API keys, etc)Keep large dependencies on the server / Reduce client-side JavaScriptAdd interactivity and event listeners (onClick(), onChange(), etc)Use State and Lifecycle Effects (useState(), useReducer(), useEffect(), etc)Use browser-only APIsUse custom hooks that depend on state, effects, or browser-only APIsUse React Class components\nServer Component Patterns\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBefore opting into client-side rendering, you may wish to do some work on the server like fetching data, or accessing your database or backend services.\nHere are some common patterns when working with Server Components:\nSharing data between components\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen fetching data on the server, there may be cases where you need to share data across different components. For example, you may have a layout and a page that depend on the same data.\nInstead of using React Context (which is not available on the server) or passing data as props, you can use fetch or React's cache function to fetch the same data in the components that need it, without worrying about making duplicate requests for the same data. This is because React extends fetch to automatically memoize data requests, and the cache function can be used when fetch is not available.\nLearn more about memoization in React.\nKeeping Server-only Code out of the Client Environment\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSince JavaScript modules can be shared between both Server and Client Components modules, it's possible for code that was only ever intended to be run on the server to sneak its way into the client.\nFor example, take the following data-fetching function:\nlib/data.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport async function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n    headers: {\n      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n    },\n  })\n \n  return res.json()\n}\n\nAt first glance, it appears that getData works on both the server and the client. However, this function contains an API_KEY, written with the intention that it would only ever be executed on the server.\nSince the environment variable API_KEY is not prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC, it's a private variable that can only be accessed on the server. To prevent your environment variables from being leaked to the client, Next.js replaces private environment variables with an empty string.\nAs a result, even though getData() can be imported and executed on the client, it won't work as expected. And while making the variable public would make the function work on the client, you may not want to expose sensitive information to the client.\nTo prevent this sort of unintended client usage of server code, we can use the server-only package to give other developers a build-time error if they ever accidentally import one of these modules into a Client Component.\nTo use server-only, first install the package:\nTerminalnpm install server-only\nThen import the package into any module that contains server-only code:\nlib/data.jsimport 'server-only'\n \nexport async function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n    headers: {\n      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n    },\n  })\n \n  return res.json()\n}\nNow, any Client Component that imports getData() will receive a build-time error explaining that this module can only be used on the server.\nThe corresponding package client-only can be used to mark modules that contain client-only code – for example, code that accesses the window object.\nUsing Third-party Packages and Providers\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSince Server Components are a new React feature, third-party packages and providers in the ecosystem are just beginning to add the \"use client\" directive to components that use client-only features like useState, useEffect, and createContext.\nToday, many components from npm packages that use client-only features do not yet have the directive. These third-party components will work as expected within Client Components since they have the \"use client\" directive, but they won't work within Server Components.\nFor example, let's say you've installed the hypothetical acme-carousel package which has a <Carousel /> component. This component uses useState, but it doesn't yet have the \"use client\" directive.\nIf you use <Carousel /> within a Client Component, it will work as expected:\napp/gallery.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n \nexport default function Gallery() {\n  let [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>\n \n      {/* Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}\n      {isOpen && <Carousel />}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nHowever, if you try to use it directly within a Server Component, you'll see an error:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>View pictures</p>\n \n      {/* Error: `useState` can not be used within Server Components */}\n      <Carousel />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nThis is because Next.js doesn't know <Carousel /> is using client-only features.\nTo fix this, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components:\napp/carousel.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n \nexport default Carousel\n\nNow, you can use <Carousel /> directly within a Server Component:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Carousel from './carousel'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>View pictures</p>\n \n      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}\n      <Carousel />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nWe don't expect you to need to wrap most third-party components since it's likely you'll be using them within Client Components. However, one exception is providers, since they rely on React state and context, and are typically needed at the root of an application. Learn more about third-party context providers below.\nUsing Context Providers\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nContext providers are typically rendered near the root of an application to share global concerns, like the current theme. Since React context is not supported in Server Components, trying to create a context at the root of your application will cause an error:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { createContext } from 'react'\n \n//  createContext is not supported in Server Components\nexport const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n \nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nTo fix this, create your context and render its provider inside of a Client Component:\napp/theme-provider.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { createContext } from 'react'\n \nexport const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n \nexport default function ThemeProvider({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n}\n\nYour Server Component will now be able to directly render your provider since it's been marked as a Client Component:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nWith the provider rendered at the root, all other Client Components throughout your app will be able to consume this context.\n\nGood to know: You should render providers as deep as possible in the tree – notice how ThemeProvider only wraps {children} instead of the entire <html> document. This makes it easier for Next.js to optimize the static parts of your Server Components.\n\nAdvice for Library Authors\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn a similar fashion, library authors creating packages to be consumed by other developers can use the \"use client\" directive to mark client entry points of their package. This allows users of the package to import package components directly into their Server Components without having to create a wrapping boundary.\nYou can optimize your package by using 'use client' deeper in the tree, allowing the imported modules to be part of the Server Component module graph.\nIt's worth noting some bundlers might strip out \"use client\" directives. You can find an example of how to configure esbuild to include the \"use client\" directive in the React Wrap Balancer and Vercel Analytics repositories.\nClient Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMoving Client Components Down the Tree\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo reduce the Client JavaScript bundle size, we recommend moving Client Components down your component tree.\nFor example, you may have a Layout that has static elements (e.g. logo, links, etc) and an interactive search bar that uses state.\nInstead of making the whole layout a Client Component, move the interactive logic to a Client Component (e.g. <SearchBar />) and keep your layout as a Server Component. This means you don't have to send all the component Javascript of the layout to the client.\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// SearchBar is a Client Component\nimport SearchBar from './searchbar'\n// Logo is a Server Component\nimport Logo from './logo'\n \n// Layout is a Server Component by default\nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Logo />\n        <SearchBar />\n      </nav>\n      <main>{children}</main>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nPassing props from Server to Client Components (Serialization)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you fetch data in a Server Component, you may want to pass data down as props to Client Components. Props passed from the Server to Client Components need to be serializable by React.\nIf your Client Components depend on data that is not serializable, you can fetch data on the client with a third party library or on the server via a Route Handler.\nInterleaving Server and Client Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen interleaving Client and Server Components, it may be helpful to visualize your UI as a tree of components. Starting with the root layout, which is a Server Component, you can then render certain subtrees of components on the client by adding the \"use client\" directive.\n\nWithin those client subtrees, you can still nest Server Components or call Server Actions, however there are some things to keep in mind:\n\nDuring a request-response lifecycle, your code moves from the server to the client. If you need to access data or resources on the server while on the client, you'll be making a new request to the server - not switching back and forth.\nWhen a new request is made to the server, all Server Components are rendered first, including those nested inside Client Components. The rendered result (RSC Payload) will contain references to the locations of Client Components. Then, on the client, React uses the RSC Payload to reconcile Server and Client Components into a single tree.\n\n\n\nSince Client Components are rendered after Server Components, you cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component module (since it would require a new request back to the server). Instead, you can pass a Server Component as props to a Client Component. See the unsupported pattern and supported pattern sections below.\n\nUnsupported Pattern: Importing Server Components into Client Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following pattern is not supported. You cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component:\napp/client-component.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \n// You cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component.\nimport ServerComponent from './Server-Component'\n \nexport default function ClientComponent({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n \n      <ServerComponent />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nSupported Pattern: Passing Server Components to Client Components as Props\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following pattern is supported. You can pass Server Components as a prop to a Client Component.\nA common pattern is to use the React children prop to create a \"slot\" in your Client Component.\nIn the example below, <ClientComponent> accepts a children prop:\napp/client-component.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useState } from 'react'\n \nexport default function ClientComponent({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n      {children}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n<ClientComponent> doesn't know that children will eventually be filled in by the result of a Server Component. The only responsibility <ClientComponent> has is to decide where children will eventually be placed.\nIn a parent Server Component, you can import both the <ClientComponent> and <ServerComponent> and pass <ServerComponent> as a child of <ClientComponent>:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// This pattern works:\n// You can pass a Server Component as a child or prop of a\n// Client Component.\nimport ClientComponent from './client-component'\nimport ServerComponent from './server-component'\n \n// Pages in Next.js are Server Components by default\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <ClientComponent>\n      <ServerComponent />\n    </ClientComponent>\n  )\n}\n\nWith this approach, <ClientComponent> and <ServerComponent> are decoupled and can be rendered independently. In this case, the child <ServerComponent> can be rendered on the server, well before <ClientComponent> is rendered on the client.\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe pattern of \"lifting content up\" has been used to avoid re-rendering a nested child component when a parent component re-renders.\nYou're not limited to the children prop. You can use any prop to pass JSX.\n\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_rendering_edge-and-nodejs-runtimes.txt","text":"Edge and Node.js Runtimes\nIn the context of Next.js, runtime refers to the set of libraries, APIs, and general functionality available to your code during execution.\nOn the server, there are two runtimes where parts of your application code can be rendered:\n\nThe Node.js Runtime (default) has access to all Node.js APIs and compatible packages from the ecosystem.\nThe Edge Runtime is based on Web APIs.\n\nRuntime Differences\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are many considerations to make when choosing a runtime. This table shows the major differences at a glance. If you want a more in-depth analysis of the differences, check out the sections below.\nNodeServerlessEdgeCold Boot/NormalLowHTTP StreamingYesYesYesIOAllAllfetchScalability/HighHighestSecurityNormalHighHighLatencyNormalLowLowestnpm PackagesAllAllA smaller subsetStatic RenderingYesYesNoDynamic RenderingYesYesYesData Revalidation w/ fetchYesYesYes\nEdge Runtime\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn Next.js, the lightweight Edge Runtime is a subset of available Node.js APIs.\nThe Edge Runtime is ideal if you need to deliver dynamic, personalized content at low latency with small, simple functions. The Edge Runtime's speed comes from its minimal use of resources, but that can be limiting in many scenarios.\nFor example, code executed in the Edge Runtime on Vercel cannot exceed between 1 MB and 4 MB, this limit includes imported packages, fonts and files, and will vary depending on your deployment infrastructure. In addition, the Edge Runtime does not support all Node.js APIs meaning some npm packages may not work. For example, \"Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'\" or similar errors. We recommend using the Node.js runtime if you need to use these APIs or packages.\nNode.js Runtime\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUsing the Node.js runtime gives you access to all Node.js APIs, and all npm packages that rely on them. However, it's not as fast to start up as routes using the Edge runtime.\nDeploying your Next.js application to a Node.js server will require managing, scaling, and configuring your infrastructure. Alternatively, you can consider deploying your Next.js application to a serverless platform like Vercel, which will handle this for you.\nServerless Node.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nServerless is ideal if you need a scalable solution that can handle more complex computational loads than the Edge Runtime. With Serverless Functions on Vercel, for example, your overall code size is 50MB including imported packages, fonts, and files.\nThe downside compared to routes using the Edge is that it can take hundreds of milliseconds for Serverless Functions to boot up before they begin processing requests. Depending on the amount of traffic your site receives, this could be a frequent occurrence as the functions are not frequently \"warm\".\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \nSegment Runtime Option\n  \n    \n    \n  \nYou can specify a runtime for individual route segments in your Next.js application. To do so, declare a variable called runtime and export it. The variable must be a string, and must have a value of either 'nodejs' or 'edge' runtime.The following example demonstrates a page route segment that exports a runtime with a value of 'edge':app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport const runtime = 'edge' // 'nodejs' (default) | 'edge'You can also define runtime on a layout level, which will make all routes under the layout run on the edge runtime:app/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport const runtime = 'edge' // 'nodejs' (default) | 'edge'If the segment runtime is not set, the default nodejs runtime will be used. You do not need to use the runtime option if you do not plan to change from the Node.js runtime.\n\nPlease refer to the Node.js Docs and Edge Docs for the full list of available APIs. Both runtimes can also support streaming depending on your deployment infrastructure.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_rendering_server-components.txt","text":"Server ComponentsReact Server Components allow you to write UI that can be rendered and optionally cached on the server. In Next.js, the rendering work is further split by route segments to enable streaming and partial rendering, and there are three different server rendering strategies:\n\nStatic Rendering\nDynamic Rendering\nStreaming\n\nThis page will go through how Server Components work, when you might use them, and the different server rendering strategies.\nBenefits of Server Rendering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the server, including:\n\nData Fetching: Server Components allow you to move data fetching to the server, closer to your data source. This can improve performance by reducing time it takes to fetch data needed for rendering, and the number of requests the client needs to make.\nSecurity: Server Components allow you to keep sensitive data and logic on the server, such as tokens and API keys, without the risk of exposing them to the client.\nCaching: By rendering on the server, the result can be cached and reused on subsequent requests and across users. This can improve performance and reduce cost by reducing the amount of rendering and data fetching done on each request.\nPerformance: Server Components give you additional tools to optimize performance from the baseline. For example, if you start with an app composed of entirely Client Components, moving non-interactive pieces of your UI to Server Components can reduce the amount of client-side JavaScript needed. This is beneficial for users with slower internet or less powerful devices, as the browser has less client-side JavaScript to download, parse, and execute.\nInitial Page Load and First Contentful Paint (FCP): On the server, we can generate HTML to allow users to view the page immediately, without waiting for the client to download, parse and execute the JavaScript needed to render the page.\nSearch Engine Optimization and Social Network Shareability: The rendered HTML can be used by search engine bots to index your pages and social network bots to generate social card previews for your pages.\nStreaming: Server Components allow you to split the rendering work into chunks and stream them to the client as they become ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page earlier without having to wait for the entire page to be rendered on the server.\n\nUsing Server Components in Next.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, Next.js uses Server Components. This allows you to automatically implement server rendering with no additional configuration, and you can opt into using Client Components when needed, see Client Components.\nHow are Server Components rendered?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOn the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks: by individual route segments and Suspense Boundaries.\nEach chunk is rendered in two steps:\n\nReact renders Server Components into a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload).\nNext.js uses the RSC Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render HTML on the server.\n\n\nThen, on the client:\n\nThe HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route - this is for the initial page load only.\nThe React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\nThe JavaScript instructions are used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.\n\n\nWhat is the React Server Component Payload (RSC)?\nThe RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The RSC Payload contains:\n\nThe rendered result of Server Components\nPlaceholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files\nAny props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component\n\n\nServer Rendering Strategies\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are three subsets of server rendering: Static, Dynamic, and Streaming.\nStatic Rendering (Default)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWith Static Rendering, routes are rendered at build time, or in the background after data revalidation. The result is cached and can be pushed to a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This optimization allows you to share the result of the rendering work between users and server requests.\nStatic rendering is useful when a route has data that is not personalized to the user and can be known at build time, such as a static blog post or a product page.\nDynamic Rendering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWith Dynamic Rendering, routes are rendered for each user at request time.\nDynamic rendering is useful when a route has data that is personalized to the user or has information that can only be known at request time, such as cookies or the URL's search params.\n\nDynamic Routes with Cached Data\nIn most websites, routes are not fully static or fully dynamic - it's a spectrum. For example, you can have an e-commerce page that uses cached product data that's revalidated at an interval, but also has uncached, personalized customer data.\nIn Next.js, you can have dynamically rendered routes that have both cached and uncached data. This is because the RSC Payload and data are cached separately. This allows you to opt into dynamic rendering without worrying about the performance impact of fetching all the data at request time.\nLearn more about the full-route cache and Data Cache.\n\nSwitching to Dynamic Rendering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDuring rendering, if a dynamic function or uncached data request is discovered, Next.js will switch to dynamically rendering the whole route. This table summarizes how dynamic functions and data caching affect whether a route is statically or dynamically rendered:\nDynamic FunctionsDataRouteNoCachedStatically RenderedYesCachedDynamically RenderedNoNot CachedDynamically RenderedYesNot CachedDynamically Rendered\nIn the table above, for a route to be fully static, all data must be cached. However, you can have a dynamically rendered route that uses both cached and uncached data fetches.\nAs a developer, you do not need to choose between static and dynamic rendering as Next.js will automatically choose the best rendering strategy for each route based on the features and APIs used. Instead, you choose when to cache or revalidate specific data, and you may choose to stream parts of your UI.\nDynamic Functions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDynamic functions rely on information that can only be known at request time such as a user's cookies, current requests headers, or the URL's search params. In Next.js, these dynamic functions are:\n\ncookies() and headers(): Using these in a Server Component will opt the whole route into dynamic rendering at request time.\nsearchParams: Using the searchParams prop on a Page will opt the page into dynamic rendering at request time.\n\nUsing any of these functions will opt the whole route into dynamic rendering at request time.\nStreaming\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nStreaming enables you to progressively render UI from the server. Work is split into chunks and streamed to the client as it becomes ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page immediately, before the entire content has finished rendering.\n\nStreaming is built into the Next.js App Router by default. This helps improve both the initial page loading performance, as well as UI that depends on slower data fetches that would block rendering the whole route. For example, reviews on a product page.\nYou can start streaming route segments using loading.js and UI components with React Suspense. See the Loading UI and Streaming section for more information."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing.txt","text":"Routing FundamentalsThe skeleton of every application is routing. This page will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of routing for the web and how to handle routing in Next.js.\nTerminology\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFirst, you will see these terms being used throughout the documentation. Here's a quick reference:\n\n\nTree: A convention for visualizing a hierarchical structure. For example, a component tree with parent and children components, a folder structure, etc.\nSubtree: Part of a tree, starting at a new root (first) and ending at the leaves (last).\nRoot: The first node in a tree or subtree, such as a root layout.\nLeaf: Nodes in a subtree that have no children, such as the last segment in a URL path.\n\n\n\nURL Segment: Part of the URL path delimited by slashes.\nURL Path: Part of the URL that comes after the domain (composed of segments).\n\nThe app Router\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn version 13, Next.js introduced a new App Router built on React Server Components, which supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.\nThe App Router works in a new directory named app. The app directory works alongside the pages directory to allow for incremental adoption. This allows you to opt some routes of your application into the new behavior while keeping other routes in the pages directory for previous behavior. If your application uses the pages directory, please also see the Pages Router documentation.\n\nGood to know: The App Router takes priority over the Pages Router. Routes across directories should not resolve to the same URL path and will cause a build-time error to prevent a conflict.\n\n\nBy default, components inside app are React Server Components. This is a performance optimization and allows you to easily adopt them, and you can also use Client Components.\n\nRecommendation: Check out the Server page if you're new to Server Components.\n\nRoles of Folders and Files\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js uses a file-system based router where:\n\nFolders are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the file-system hierarchy from the root folder down to a final leaf folder that includes a page.js file. See Defining Routes.\nFiles are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment. See special files.\n\nRoute Segments\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nEach folder in a route represents a route segment. Each route segment is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.\n\nNested Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, you can add a new /dashboard/settings route by nesting two new folders in the app directory.\nThe /dashboard/settings route is composed of three segments:\n\n/ (Root segment)\ndashboard (Segment)\nsettings (Leaf segment)\n\nFile Conventions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js provides a set of special files to create UI with specific behavior in nested routes:\nlayoutShared UI for a segment and its childrenpageUnique UI of a route and make routes publicly accessibleloadingLoading UI for a segment and its childrennot-foundNot found UI for a segment and its childrenerrorError UI for a segment and its childrenglobal-errorGlobal Error UIrouteServer-side API endpointtemplateSpecialized re-rendered Layout UIdefaultFallback UI for Parallel Routes\n\nGood to know: .js, .jsx, or .tsx file extensions can be used for special files.\n\nComponent Hierarchy\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe React components defined in special files of a route segment are rendered in a specific hierarchy:\n\nlayout.js\ntemplate.js\nerror.js (React error boundary)\nloading.js (React suspense boundary)\nnot-found.js (React error boundary)\npage.js or nested layout.js\n\n\nIn a nested route, the components of a segment will be nested inside the components of its parent segment.\n\nColocation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn addition to special files, you have the option to colocate your own files (e.g. components, styles, tests, etc) inside folders in the app directory.\nThis is because while folders define routes, only the contents returned by page.js or route.js are publicly addressable.\n\nLearn more about Project Organization and Colocation.\nAdvanced Routing Patterns\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe App Router also provides a set of conventions to help you implement more advanced routing patterns. These include:\n\nParallel Routes: Allow you to simultaneously show two or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. You can use them for split views that have their own sub-navigation. E.g. Dashboards.\nIntercepting Routes: Allow you to intercept a route and show it in the context of another route. You can use these when keeping the context for the current page is important. E.g. Seeing all tasks while editing one task or expanding a photo in a feed.\n\nThese patterns allow you to build richer and more complex UIs, democratizing features that were historically complex for small teams and individual developers to implement.\nNext Steps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNow that you understand the fundamentals of routing in Next.js, follow the links below to create your first routes:"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_colocation.txt","text":"Project Organization and File ColocationApart from routing folder and file conventions, Next.js is unopinionated about how you organize and colocate your project files.\nThis page shares default behavior and features you can use to organize your project.\n\nSafe colocation by default\nProject organization features\nProject organization strategies\n\nSafe colocation by default\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the app directory, nested folder hierarchy defines route structure.\nEach folder represents a route segment that is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.\nHowever, even though route structure is defined through folders, a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.\n\nAnd, even when a route is made publicly accessible, only the content returned by page.js or route.js is sent to the client.\n\nThis means that project files can be safely colocated inside route segments in the app directory without accidentally being routable.\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nThis is different from the pages directory, where any file in pages is considered a route.\nWhile you can colocate your project files in app you don't have to. If you prefer, you can keep them outside the app directory.\n\n\nProject organization features\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js provides several features to help you organize your project.\nPrivate Folders\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPrivate folders can be created by prefixing a folder with an underscore: _folderName\nThis indicates the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system, thereby opting the folder and all its subfolders out of routing.\n\nSince files in the app directory can be safely colocated by default, private folders are not required for colocation. However, they can be useful for:\n\nSeparating UI logic from routing logic.\nConsistently organizing internal files across a project and the Next.js ecosystem.\nSorting and grouping files in code editors.\nAvoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.\n\n\nGood to know\n\nWhile not a framework convention, you might also consider marking files outside private folders as \"private\" using the same underscore pattern.\nYou can create URL segments that start with an underscore by prefixing the folder name with %5F (the URL-encoded form of an underscore): %5FfolderName.\nIf you don't use private folders, it would be helpful to know Next.js special file conventions to prevent unexpected naming conflicts.\n\n\nRoute Groups\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nRoute groups can be created by wrapping a folder in parenthesis: (folderName)\nThis indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should not be included in the route's URL path.\n\nRoute groups are useful for:\n\nOrganizing routes into groups e.g. by site section, intent, or team.\nEnabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:\n\nCreating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts\nAdding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment\n\n\n\nsrc Directory\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js supports storing application code (including app) inside an optional src directory. This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.\n\nModule Path Aliases\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js supports Module Path Aliases which make it easier to read and maintain imports across deeply nested project files.\napp/dashboard/settings/analytics/page.js// before\nimport { Button } from '../../../components/button'\n \n// after\nimport { Button } from '@/components/button'\nProject organization strategies\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way when it comes to organizing your own files and folders in a Next.js project.\nThe following section lists a very high-level overview of common strategies. The simplest takeaway is to choose a strategy that works for you and your team and be consistent across the project.\n\nGood to know: In our examples below, we're using components and lib folders as generalized placeholders, their naming has no special framework significance and your projects might use other folders like ui, utils, hooks, styles, etc.\n\nStore project files outside of app\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the root of your project and keeps the app directory purely for routing purposes.\n\nStore project files in top-level folders inside of app\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the root of the app directory.\n\nSplit project files by feature or route\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis strategy stores globally shared application code in the root app directory and splits more specific application code into the route segments that use them.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_defining-routes.txt","text":"Defining Routes\nWe recommend reading the Routing Fundamentals page before continuing.\n\nThis page will guide you through how to define and organize routes in your Next.js application.\nCreating Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js uses a file-system based router where folders are used to define routes.\nEach folder represents a route segment that maps to a URL segment. To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other.\n\nA special page.js file is used to make route segments publicly accessible.\n\nIn this example, the /dashboard/analytics URL path is not publicly accessible because it does not have a corresponding page.js file. This folder could be used to store components, stylesheets, images, or other colocated files.\n\nGood to know: .js, .jsx, or .tsx file extensions can be used for special files.\n\nCreating UI\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSpecial file conventions are used to create UI for each route segment. The most common are pages to show UI unique to a route, and layouts to show UI that is shared across multiple routes.\nFor example, to create your first page, add a page.js file inside the app directory and export a React component:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_dynamic-routes.txt","text":"Dynamic RoutesWhen you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time or prerendered at build time.\nConvention\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets: [folderName]. For example, [id] or [slug].\nDynamic Segments are passed as the params prop to layout, page, route, and generateMetadata functions.\nExample\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor example, a blog could include the following route app/blog/[slug]/page.js where [slug] is the Dynamic Segment for blog posts.\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  return <div>My Post: {params.slug}</div>\n}\n\nRouteExample URLparamsapp/blog/[slug]/page.js/blog/a{ slug: 'a' }app/blog/[slug]/page.js/blog/b{ slug: 'b' }app/blog/[slug]/page.js/blog/c{ slug: 'c' }\nSee the generateStaticParams() page to learn how to generate the params for the segment.\n\nGood to know: Dynamic Segments are equivalent to Dynamic Routes in the pages directory.\n\nGenerating Static Params\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe generateStaticParams function can be used in combination with dynamic route segments to statically generate routes at build time instead of on-demand at request time.\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())\n \n  return posts.map((post) => ({\n    slug: post.slug,\n  }))\n}\n\nThe primary benefit of the generateStaticParams function is its smart retrieval of data. If content is fetched within the generateStaticParams function using a fetch request, the requests are automatically memoized. This means a fetch request with the same arguments across multiple generateStaticParams, Layouts, and Pages will only be made once, which decreases build times.\nUse the migration guide if you are migrating from the pages directory.\nSee generateStaticParams server function documentation for more information and advanced use cases.\nCatch-all Segments\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDynamic Segments can be extended to catch-all subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets [...folderName].\nFor example, app/shop/[...slug]/page.js will match /shop/clothes, but also /shop/clothes/tops, /shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts, and so on.\nRouteExample URLparamsapp/shop/[...slug]/page.js/shop/a{ slug: ['a'] }app/shop/[...slug]/page.js/shop/a/b{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }app/shop/[...slug]/page.js/shop/a/b/c{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }\nOptional Catch-all Segments\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCatch-all Segments can be made optional by including the parameter in double square brackets: [[...folderName]].\nFor example, app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js will also match /shop, in addition to /shop/clothes, /shop/clothes/tops, /shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts.\nThe difference between catch-all and optional catch-all segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (/shop in the example above).\nRouteExample URLparamsapp/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js/shop{}app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js/shop/a{ slug: ['a'] }app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js/shop/a/b{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js/shop/a/b/c{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }\nTypeScript\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen using TypeScript, you can add types for params depending on your configured route segment.\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  return <h1>My Page</h1>\n}\n\nRouteparams Type Definitionapp/blog/[slug]/page.js{ slug: string }app/shop/[...slug]/page.js{ slug: string[] }app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js{ slug?: string[] }app/[categoryId]/[itemId]/page.js{ categoryId: string, itemId: string }\n\nGood to know: This may be done automatically by the TypeScript plugin in the future.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_error-handling.txt","text":"Error HandlingThe error.js file convention allows you to gracefully handle unexpected runtime errors in nested routes.\n\nAutomatically wrap a route segment and its nested children in a React Error Boundary.\nCreate error UI tailored to specific segments using the file-system hierarchy to adjust granularity.\nIsolate errors to affected segments while keeping the rest of the application functional.\nAdd functionality to attempt to recover from an error without a full page reload.\n\nCreate error UI by adding an error.js file inside a route segment and exporting a React component:\n\napp/dashboard/error.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client' // Error components must be Client Components\n \nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\n \nexport default function Error({\n  error,\n  reset,\n}: {\n  error: Error & { digest?: string }\n  reset: () => void\n}) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Log the error to an error reporting service\n    console.error(error)\n  }, [error])\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>\n      <button\n        onClick={\n          // Attempt to recover by trying to re-render the segment\n          () => reset()\n        }\n      >\n        Try again\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nHow error.js Works\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nerror.js automatically creates a React Error Boundary that wraps a nested child segment or page.js component.\nThe React component exported from the error.js file is used as the fallback component.\nIf an error is thrown within the error boundary, the error is contained, and the fallback component is rendered.\nWhen the fallback error component is active, layouts above the error boundary maintain their state and remain interactive, and the error component can display functionality to recover from the error.\n\nRecovering From Errors\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe cause of an error can sometimes be temporary. In these cases, simply trying again might resolve the issue.\nAn error component can use the reset() function to prompt the user to attempt to recover from the error. When executed, the function will try to re-render the Error boundary's contents. If successful, the fallback error component is replaced with the result of the re-render.\napp/dashboard/error.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nexport default function Error({\n  error,\n  reset,\n}: {\n  error: Error & { digest?: string }\n  reset: () => void\n}) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>\n      <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nNested Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nReact components created through special files are rendered in a specific nested hierarchy.\nFor example, a nested route with two segments that both include layout.js and error.js files are rendered in the following simplified component hierarchy:\n\nThe nested component hierarchy has implications for the behavior of error.js files across a nested route:\n\nErrors bubble up to the nearest parent error boundary. This means an error.js file will handle errors for all its nested child segments. More or less granular error UI can be achieved by placing error.js files at different levels in the nested folders of a route.\nAn error.js boundary will not handle errors thrown in a layout.js component in the same segment because the error boundary is nested inside that layout's component.\n\nHandling Errors in Layouts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nerror.js boundaries do not catch errors thrown in layout.js or template.js components of the same segment. This intentional hierarchy keeps important UI that is shared between sibling routes (such as navigation) visible and functional when an error occurs.\nTo handle errors within a specific layout or template, place an error.js file in the layout's parent segment.\nTo handle errors within the root layout or template, use a variation of error.js called global-error.js.\nHandling Errors in Root Layouts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe root app/error.js boundary does not catch errors thrown in the root app/layout.js or app/template.js component.\nTo specifically handle errors in these root components, use a variation of error.js called app/global-error.js located in the root app directory.\nUnlike the root error.js, the global-error.js error boundary wraps the entire application, and its fallback component replaces the root layout when active. Because of this, it is important to note that global-error.js must define its own <html> and <body> tags.\nglobal-error.js is the least granular error UI and can be considered \"catch-all\" error handling for the whole application. It is unlikely to be triggered often as root components are typically less dynamic, and other error.js boundaries will catch most errors.\nEven if a global-error.js is defined, it is still recommended to define a root error.js whose fallback component will be rendered within the root layout, which includes globally shared UI and branding.\napp/global-error.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nexport default function GlobalError({\n  error,\n  reset,\n}: {\n  error: Error & { digest?: string }\n  reset: () => void\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>\n        <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nglobal-error.js is only enabled in production. In development, our error overlay will show instead.\n\n\nHandling Server Errors\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf an error is thrown inside a Server Component, Next.js will forward an Error object (stripped of sensitive error information in production) to the nearest error.js file as the error prop.\nSecuring Sensitive Error Information\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDuring production, the Error object forwarded to the client only includes a generic message and digest property.\nThis is a security precaution to avoid leaking potentially sensitive details included in the error to the client.\nThe message property contains a generic message about the error and the digest property contains an automatically generated hash of the error that can be used to match the corresponding error in server-side logs.\nDuring development, the Error object forwarded to the client will be serialized and include the message of the original error for easier debugging."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_intercepting-routes.txt","text":"Intercepting RoutesIntercepting routes allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. This routing paradigm can be useful when you want to display the content of a route without the user switching to a different context.\nFor example, when clicking on a photo in a feed, you can display the photo in a modal, overlaying the feed. In this case, Next.js intercepts the /photo/123 route, masks the URL, and overlays it over /feed.\n\nHowever, when navigating to the photo by clicking a shareable URL or by refreshing the page, the entire photo page should render instead of the modal. No route interception should occur.\n\nConvention\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIntercepting routes can be defined with the (..) convention, which is similar to relative path convention ../ but for segments.\nYou can use:\n\n(.) to match segments on the same level\n(..) to match segments one level above\n(..)(..) to match segments two levels above\n(...) to match segments from the root app directory\n\nFor example, you can intercept the photo segment from within the feed segment by creating a (..)photo directory.\n\n\nNote that the (..) convention is based on route segments, not the file-system.\n\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nModals\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIntercepting Routes can be used together with Parallel Routes to create modals. This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:\n\nMaking the modal content shareable through a URL.\nPreserving context when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.\nClosing the modal on backwards navigation rather than going to the previous route.\nReopening the modal on forwards navigation.\n\nConsider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a photo modal from a gallery using client-side navigation, or navigate to the photo page directly from a shareable URL:\n\nIn the above example, the path to the photo segment can use the (..) matcher since @modal is a slot and not a segment. This means that the photo route is only one segment level higher, despite being two file-system levels higher.\nSee the Parallel Routes documentation for a step-by-step example, or see our image gallery example.\n\nGood to know:\n\nOther examples could include opening a login modal in a top navbar while also having a dedicated /login page, or opening a shopping cart in a side modal.\n\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_internationalization.txt","text":"InternationalizationNext.js enables you to configure the routing and rendering of content to support multiple languages. Making your site adaptive to different locales includes translated content (localization) and internationalized routes.\nTerminology\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nLocale: An identifier for a set of language and formatting preferences. This usually includes the preferred language of the user and possibly their geographic region.\n\nen-US: English as spoken in the United States\nnl-NL: Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands\nnl: Dutch, no specific region\n\n\n\nRouting Overview\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIt’s recommended to use the user’s language preferences in the browser to select which locale to use. Changing your preferred language will modify the incoming Accept-Language header to your application.\nFor example, using the following libraries, you can look at an incoming Request to determine which locale to select, based on the Headers, locales you plan to support, and the default locale.\nmiddleware.jsimport { match } from '@formatjs/intl-localematcher'\nimport Negotiator from 'negotiator'\n \nlet headers = { 'accept-language': 'en-US,en;q=0.5' }\nlet languages = new Negotiator({ headers }).languages()\nlet locales = ['en-US', 'nl-NL', 'nl']\nlet defaultLocale = 'en-US'\n \nmatch(languages, locales, defaultLocale) // -> 'en-US'\nRouting can be internationalized by either the sub-path (/fr/products) or domain (my-site.fr/products). With this information, you can now redirect the user based on the locale inside Middleware.\nmiddleware.jsimport { NextResponse } from \"next/server\";\n \nlet locales = ['en-US', 'nl-NL', 'nl']\n \n// Get the preferred locale, similar to the above or using a library\nfunction getLocale(request) { ... }\n \nexport function middleware(request) {\n  // Check if there is any supported locale in the pathname\n  const { pathname } = request.nextUrl\n  const pathnameHasLocale = locales.some(\n    (locale) => pathname.startsWith(`/${locale}/`) || pathname === `/${locale}`\n  )\n \n  if (pathnameHasLocale) return\n \n  // Redirect if there is no locale\n  const locale = getLocale(request)\n  request.nextUrl.pathname = `/${locale}${pathname}`\n  // e.g. incoming request is /products\n  // The new URL is now /en-US/products\n  return NextResponse.redirect(request.nextUrl)\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    // Skip all internal paths (_next)\n    '/((?!_next).*)',\n    // Optional: only run on root (/) URL\n    // '/'\n  ],\n}\nFinally, ensure all special files inside app/ are nested under app/[lang]. This enables the Next.js router to dynamically handle different locales in the route, and forward the lang parameter to every layout and page. For example:\napp/[lang]/page.js// You now have access to the current locale\n// e.g. /en-US/products -> `lang` is \"en-US\"\nexport default async function Page({ params: { lang } }) {\n  return ...\n}\nThe root layout can also be nested in the new folder (e.g. app/[lang]/layout.js).\nLocalization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nChanging displayed content based on the user’s preferred locale, or localization, is not something specific to Next.js. The patterns described below would work the same with any web application.\nLet’s assume we want to support both English and Dutch content inside our application. We might maintain two different “dictionaries”, which are objects that give us a mapping from some key to a localized string. For example:\ndictionaries/en.json{\n  \"products\": {\n    \"cart\": \"Add to Cart\"\n  }\n}\ndictionaries/nl.json{\n  \"products\": {\n    \"cart\": \"Toevoegen aan Winkelwagen\"\n  }\n}\nWe can then create a getDictionary function to load the translations for the requested locale:\napp/[lang]/dictionaries.jsimport 'server-only'\n \nconst dictionaries = {\n  en: () => import('./dictionaries/en.json').then((module) => module.default),\n  nl: () => import('./dictionaries/nl.json').then((module) => module.default),\n}\n \nexport const getDictionary = async (locale) => dictionaries[locale]()\nGiven the currently selected language, we can fetch the dictionary inside of a layout or page.\napp/[lang]/page.jsimport { getDictionary } from './dictionaries'\n \nexport default async function Page({ params: { lang } }) {\n  const dict = await getDictionary(lang) // en\n  return <button>{dict.products.cart}</button> // Add to Cart\n}\nBecause all layouts and pages in the app/ directory default to Server Components, we do not need to worry about the size of the translation files affecting our client-side JavaScript bundle size. This code will only run on the server, and only the resulting HTML will be sent to the browser.\nStatic Generation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo generate static routes for a given set of locales, we can use generateStaticParams with any page or layout. This can be global, for example, in the root layout:\napp/[lang]/layout.jsexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ lang: 'en-US' }, { lang: 'de' }]\n}\n \nexport default function Root({ children, params }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang={params.lang}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\nResources\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nMinimal i18n routing and translations\nnext-intl\nnext-international\nnext-i18n-router\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_linking-and-navigating.txt","text":"Linking and NavigatingThere are four ways to navigate between routes in Next.js:\n\nUsing the <Link> Component\nUsing the useRouter hook (Client Components)\nUsing the redirect function (Server Components)\nUsing the native History API\n\nThis page will go through how to use each of these options, and dive deeper into how navigation works.\n<Link> Component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n<Link> is a built-in component that extends the HTML <a> tag to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes.

'active' : ''}`}\n            href=\"/about\"\n          >\n            About\n          </Link>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </nav>\n  )\n}\n\nScrolling to an id\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default behavior of the Next.js App Router is to scroll to the top of a new route or to maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation.\nIf you'd like to scroll to a specific id on navigation, you can append your URL with a # hash link or just pass a hash link to the href prop. This is possible since <Link> renders to an <a> element.\n<Link href=\"/dashboard#settings\">Settings</Link>\n \n// Output\n<a href=\"/dashboard#settings\">Settings</a>\n\nGood to know:\n\nNext.js will scroll to the Page if it is not visible in the viewport upon navigation.\n\n\nDisabling scroll restoration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default behavior of the Next.js App Router is to scroll to the top of a new route or to maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation. If you'd like to disable this behavior, you can pass scroll={false} to the <Link> component, or scroll: false to router.push() or router.replace().\n// next/link\n<Link href=\"/dashboard\" scroll={false}>\n  Dashboard\n</Link>\n// useRouter\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n \nconst router = useRouter()\n \nrouter.push('/dashboard', { scroll: false })\nuseRouter() hook\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe useRouter hook allows you to programmatically change routes from Client Components.\napp/page.js'use client'\n \nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\nFor a full list of useRouter methods, see the API reference.\n\nRecommendation: Use the <Link> component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using useRouter.\n\nredirect function\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor Server Components, use the redirect function instead.\napp/team/[id]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n \nasync function fetchTeam(id: string) {\n  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n  if (!res.ok) return undefined\n  return res.json()\n}\n \nexport default async function Profile({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {\n  const team = await fetchTeam(params.id)\n  if (!team) {\n    redirect('/login')\n  }\n \n  // ...\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nredirect returns a 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code by default. When used in a Server Action, it returns a 303 (See Other), which is commonly used for redirecting to a success page as a result of a POST request.\nredirect internally throws an error so it should be called outside of try/catch blocks.\nredirect can be called in Client Components during the rendering process but not in event handlers. You can use the useRouter hook instead.\nredirect also accepts absolute URLs and can be used to redirect to external links.\nIf you'd like to redirect before the render process, use next.config.js or Middleware.\n\n\nSee the redirect API reference for more information.\nUsing the native History API\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js allows you to use the native window.history.pushState and window.history.replaceState methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.\npushState and replaceState calls integrate into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with usePathname and useSearchParams.\nwindow.history.pushState\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUse it to add a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous state. For example, to sort a list of products:\n'use client'\n \nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function SortProducts() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {\n    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())\n    params.set('sort', sortOrder)\n    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>\n      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nwindow.history.replaceState\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUse it to replace the current entry on the browser's history stack. The user is not able to navigate back to the previous state. For example, to switch the application's locale:\n'use client'\n \nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport function LocaleSwitcher() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n \n  function switchLocale(locale: string) {\n    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'\n    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`\n    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>\n      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nHow Routing and Navigation Works\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe App Router uses a hybrid approach for routing and navigation. On the server, your application code is automatically code-split by route segments. And on the client, Next.js prefetches and caches the route segments. This means, when a user navigates to a new route, the browser doesn't reload the page, and only the route segments that change re-render - improving the navigation experience and performance.\n1. Code Splitting\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCode splitting allows you to split your application code into smaller bundles to be downloaded and executed by the browser. This reduces the amount of data transferred and execution time for each request, leading to improved performance.\nServer Components allow your application code to be automatically code-split by route segments. This means only the code needed for the current route is loaded on navigation.\n2. Prefetching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPrefetching is a way to preload a route in the background before the user visits it.\nThere are two ways routes are prefetched in Next.js:\n\n<Link> component: Routes are automatically prefetched as they become visible in the user's viewport. Prefetching happens when the page first loads or when it comes into view through scrolling.\nrouter.prefetch(): The useRouter hook can be used to prefetch routes programmatically.\n\nThe <Link>'s default prefetching behavior (i.e. when the prefetch prop is left unspecified or set to null) is different depending on your usage of loading.js. Only the shared layout, down the rendered \"tree\" of components until the first loading.js file, is prefetched and cached for 30s. This reduces the cost of fetching an entire dynamic route, and it means you can show an instant loading state for better visual feedback to users.\nYou can disable prefetching by setting the prefetch prop to false. Alternatively, you can prefetch the full page data beyond the loading boundaries by setting the prefetch prop to true.\nSee the <Link> API reference for more information.\n\nGood to know:\n\nPrefetching is not enabled in development, only in production.\n\n\n3. Caching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has an in-memory client-side cache called the Router Cache. As users navigate around the app, the React Server Component Payload of prefetched route segments and visited routes are stored in the cache.\nThis means on navigation, the cache is reused as much as possible, instead of making a new request to the server - improving performance by reducing the number of requests and data transferred.\nLearn more about how the Router Cache works and how to configure it.\n4. Partial Rendering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPartial rendering means only the route segments that change on navigation re-render on the client, and any shared segments are preserved.\nFor example, when navigating between two sibling routes, /dashboard/settings and /dashboard/analytics, the settings and analytics pages will be rendered, and the shared dashboard layout will be preserved.\n\nWithout partial rendering, each navigation would cause the full page to re-render on the client. Rendering only the segment that changes reduces the amount of data transferred and execution time, leading to improved performance.\n5. Soft Navigation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBrowsers perform a \"hard navigation\" when navigating between pages. The Next.js App Router enables \"soft navigation\" between pages, ensuring only the route segments that have changed are re-rendered (partial rendering). This enables client React state to be preserved during navigation.\n6. Back and Forward Navigation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, Next.js will maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation, and re-use route segments in the Router Cache.\n7. Routing between pages/ and app/\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen incrementally migrating from pages/ to app/, the Next.js router will automatically handle hard navigation between the two. To detect transitions from pages/ to app/, there is a client router filter that leverages probabilistic checking of app routes, which can occasionally result in false positives. By default, such occurrences should be very rare, as we configure the false positive likelihood to be 0.01%. This likelihood can be customized via the experimental.clientRouterFilterAllowedRate option in next.config.js. It's important to note that lowering the false positive rate will increase the size of the generated filter in the client bundle.\nAlternatively, if you prefer to disable this handling completely and manage the routing between pages/ and app/ manually, you can set experimental.clientRouterFilter to false in next.config.js. When this feature is disabled, any dynamic routes in pages that overlap with app routes won't be navigated to properly by default."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_loading-ui-and-streaming.txt","text":"Loading UI and StreamingThe special file loading.js helps you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense. With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads. The new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.\n\nInstant Loading States\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAn instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately upon navigation. You can pre-render loading indicators such as skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc. This helps users understand the app is responding and provides a better user experience.\nCreate a loading state by adding a loading.js file inside a folder.\n\napp/dashboard/loading.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Loading() {\n  // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.\n  return <LoadingSkeleton />\n}\n\nIn the same folder, loading.js will be nested inside layout.js. It will automatically wrap the page.js file and any children below in a <Suspense> boundary.\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nNavigation is immediate, even with server-centric routing.\nNavigation is interruptible, meaning changing routes does not need to wait for the content of the route to fully load before navigating to another route.\nShared layouts remain interactive while new route segments load.\n\n\n\nRecommendation: Use the loading.js convention for route segments (layouts and pages) as Next.js optimizes this functionality.\n\nStreaming with Suspense\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn addition to loading.js, you can also manually create Suspense Boundaries for your own UI components. The App Router supports streaming with Suspense for both Node.js and Edge runtimes.\n\nGood to know:\n\nSome browsers buffer a streaming response. You may not see the streamed response until the exceeds 1024 bytes. This typically only affects “hello world” applications, but not real applications.\n\n\nWhat is Streaming?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo learn how Streaming works in React and Next.js, it's helpful to understand Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and its limitations.\nWith SSR, there's a series of steps that need to be completed before a user can see and interact with a page:\n\nFirst, all data for a given page is fetched on the server.\nThe server then renders the HTML for the page.\nThe HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the page are sent to the client.\nA non-interactive user interface is shown using the generated HTML, and CSS.\nFinally, React hydrates the user interface to make it interactive.\n\n\nThese steps are sequential and blocking, meaning the server can only render the HTML for a page once all the data has been fetched. And, on the client, React can only hydrate the UI once the code for all components in the page has been downloaded.\nSSR with React and Next.js helps improve the perceived loading performance by showing a non-interactive page to the user as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, it can still be slow as all data fetching on server needs to be completed before the page can be shown to the user.\nStreaming allows you to break down the page's HTML into smaller chunks and progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.\n\nThis enables parts of the page to be displayed sooner, without waiting for all the data to load before any UI can be rendered.\nStreaming works well with React's component model because each component can be considered a chunk. Components that have higher priority (e.g. product information) or that don't rely on data can be sent first (e.g. layout), and React can start hydration earlier. Components that have lower priority (e.g. reviews, related products) can be sent in the same server request after their data has been fetched.\n\nStreaming is particularly beneficial when you want to prevent long data requests from blocking the page from rendering as it can reduce the Time To First Byte (TTFB) and First Contentful Paint (FCP). It also helps improve Time to Interactive (TTI), especially on slower devices.\nExample\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n<Suspense> works by wrapping a component that performs an asynchronous action (e.g. fetch data), showing fallback UI (e.g. skeleton, spinner) while it's happening, and then swapping in your component once the action completes.\napp/dashboard/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { PostFeed, Weather } from './Components'\n \nexport default function Posts() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>\n        <PostFeed />\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>\n        <Weather />\n      </Suspense>\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nBy using Suspense, you get the benefits of:\n\nStreaming Server Rendering - Progressively rendering HTML from the server to the client.\nSelective Hydration - React prioritizes what components to make interactive first based on user interaction.\n\nFor more Suspense examples and use cases, please see the React Documentation.\nSEO\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nNext.js will wait for data fetching inside generateMetadata to complete before streaming UI to the client. This guarantees the first part of a streamed response includes <head> tags.\nSince streaming is server-rendered, it does not impact SEO. You can use the Rich Results Test tool from Google to see how your page appears to Google's web crawlers and view the serialized HTML (source).\n\nStatus Codes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen streaming, a 200 status code will be returned to signal that the request was successful.\nThe server can still communicate errors or issues to the client within the streamed content itself, for example, when using redirect or notFound. Since the response headers have already been sent to the client, the status code of the response cannot be updated. This does not affect SEO."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_middleware.txt","text":"Middleware\nMiddleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.\nMiddleware runs before cached content and routes are matched. See Matching Paths for more details.\nUse Cases\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIntegrating Middleware into your application can lead to significant improvements in performance, security, and user experience. Some common scenarios where Middleware is particularly effective include:\n\nAuthentication and Authorization: Ensure user identity and check session cookies before granting access to specific pages or API routes.\nServer-Side Redirects: Redirect users at the server level based on certain conditions (e.g., locale, user role).\nPath Rewriting: Support A/B testing, feature rollouts, or legacy paths by dynamically rewriting paths to API routes or pages based on request properties.\nBot Detection: Protect your resources by detecting and blocking bot traffic.\nLogging and Analytics: Capture and analyze request data for insights before processing by the page or API.\nFeature Flagging: Enable or disable features dynamically for seamless feature rollouts or testing.\n\nRecognizing situations where middleware may not be the optimal approach is just as crucial. Here are some scenarios to be mindful of:\n\nComplex Data Fetching and Manipulation: Middleware is not designed for direct data fetching or manipulation, this should be done within Route Handlers or server-side utilities instead.\nHeavy Computational Tasks: Middleware should be lightweight and respond quickly or it can cause delays in page load. Heavy computational tasks or long-running processes should be done within dedicated Route Handlers.\nExtensive Session Management: While Middleware can manage basic session tasks, extensive session management should be managed by dedicated authentication services or within Route Handlers.\nDirect Database Operations: Performing direct database operations within Middleware is not recommended. Database interactions should done within Route Handlers or server-side utilities.\n\nConvention\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUse the file middleware.ts (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as pages or app, or inside src if applicable.\n\nNote: While only one middleware.ts file is supported per project, you can still organize your middleware logic modularly. Break out middleware functionalities into separate .ts or .js files and import them into your main middleware.ts file. This allows for cleaner management of route-specific middleware, aggregated in the middleware.ts for centralized control. By enforcing a single middleware file, it simplifies configuration, prevents potential conflicts, and optimizes performance by avoiding multiple middleware layers.\n\nExample\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \n// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))\n}\n \n// See \"Matching Paths\" below to learn more\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\n\nMatching Paths\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware will be invoked for every route in your project. Given this, it's crucial to use matchers to precisely target or exclude specific routes. The following is the execution order:\n\nheaders from next.config.js\nredirects from next.config.js\nMiddleware (rewrites, redirects, etc.)\nbeforeFiles (rewrites) from next.config.js\nFilesystem routes (public/, _next/static/, pages/, app/, etc.)\nafterFiles (rewrites) from next.config.js\nDynamic Routes (/blog/[slug])\nfallback (rewrites) from next.config.js\n\nThere are two ways to define which paths Middleware will run on:\n\nCustom matcher config\nConditional statements\n\nMatcher\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nmatcher allows you to filter Middleware to run on specific paths.\nmiddleware.jsexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\nYou can match a single path or multiple paths with an array syntax:\nmiddleware.jsexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/about/:path*', '/dashboard/:path*'],\n}\nThe matcher config allows full regex so matching like negative lookaheads or character matching is supported. An example of a negative lookahead to match all except specific paths can be seen here:\nmiddleware.jsexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n  ],\n}\nYou can also bypass Middleware for certain requests by using the missing or has arrays, or a combination of both:\nmiddleware.jsexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      missing: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n \n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      has: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n \n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      has: [{ type: 'header', key: 'x-present' }],\n      missing: [{ type: 'header', key: 'x-missing', value: 'prefetch' }],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n\nGood to know: The matcher values need to be constants so they can be statically analyzed at build-time. Dynamic values such as variables will be ignored.\n\nConfigured matchers:\n\nMUST start with /\nCan include named parameters: /about/:path matches /about/a and /about/b but not /about/a/c\nCan have modifiers on named parameters (starting with :): /about/:path* matches /about/a/b/c because * is zero or more. ? is zero or one and + one or more\nCan use regular expression enclosed in parenthesis: /about/(.*) is the same as /about/:path*\n\nRead more details on path-to-regexp documentation.\n\nGood to know: For backward compatibility, Next.js always considers /public as /public/index. Therefore, a matcher of /public/:path will match.\n\nConditional Statements\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/about')) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/about-2', request.url))\n  }\n \n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/dashboard/user', request.url))\n  }\n}\n\nNextResponse\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe NextResponse API allows you to:\n\nredirect the incoming request to a different URL\nrewrite the response by displaying a given URL\nSet request headers for API Routes, getServerSideProps, and rewrite destinations\nSet response cookies\nSet response headers\n\nTo produce a response from Middleware, you can:\nrewrite to a route (Page or Route Handler) that produces a response\nreturn a NextResponse directly.

This page will guide you through how and when to use these special files.\nPages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA page is UI that is unique to a route. You can define a page by default exporting a component from a page.js file.\nFor example, to create your index page, add the page.js file inside the app directory:\n\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// `app/page.tsx` is the UI for the `/` URL\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Home page!</h1>\n}\n\nThen, to create further pages, create a new folder and add the page.js file inside it. For example, to create a page for the /dashboard route, create a new folder called dashboard, and add the page.js file inside it:\napp/dashboard/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// `app/dashboard/page.tsx` is the UI for the `/dashboard` URL\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Dashboard Page!</h1>\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe .js, .jsx, or .tsx file extensions can be used for Pages.\nA page is always the leaf of the route subtree.\nA page.js file is required to make a route segment publicly accessible.\nPages are Server Components by default, but can be set to a Client Component.\nPages can fetch data. View the Data Fetching section for more information.\n\n\nLayouts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA layout is UI that is shared between multiple routes. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render. Layouts can also be nested.\nYou can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout.js file. The component should accept a children prop that will be populated with a child layout (if it exists) or a page during rendering.\nFor example, the layout will be shared with the /dashboard and /dashboard/settings pages:\n\napp/dashboard/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function DashboardLayout({\n  children, // will be a page or nested layout\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      {/* Include shared UI here e.g. a header or sidebar */}\n      <nav></nav>\n \n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nRoot Layout (Required)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe root layout is defined at the top level of the app directory and applies to all routes. This layout is required and must contain html and body tags, allowing you to modify the initial HTML returned from the server.\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        {/* Layout UI */}\n        <main>{children}</main>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nNesting Layouts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, layouts in the folder hierarchy are nested, which means they wrap child layouts via their children prop. You can nest layouts by adding layout.js inside specific route segments (folders).\nFor example, to create a layout for the /dashboard route, add a new layout.js file inside the dashboard folder:\n\napp/dashboard/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function DashboardLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return <section>{children}</section>\n}\n\nIf you were to combine the two layouts above, the root layout (app/layout.js) would wrap the dashboard layout (app/dashboard/layout.js), which would wrap route segments inside app/dashboard/*.\nThe two layouts would be nested as such:\n\n\nGood to know:\n\n.js, .jsx, or .tsx file extensions can be used for Layouts.\nOnly the root layout can contain <html> and <body> tags.\nWhen a layout.js and page.js file are defined in the same folder, the layout will wrap the page.\nLayouts are Server Components by default but can be set to a Client Component.\nLayouts can fetch data. View the Data Fetching section for more information.\nPassing data between a parent layout and its children is not possible. However, you can fetch the same data in a route more than once, and React will automatically dedupe the requests without affecting performance.\nLayouts do not have access to the route segments below itself. To access all route segments, you can use useSelectedLayoutSegment or useSelectedLayoutSegments in a Client Component.\nYou can use Route Groups to opt specific route segments in and out of shared layouts.\nYou can use Route Groups to create multiple root layouts. See an example here.\nMigrating from the pages directory: The root layout replaces the _app.js and _document.js files. View the migration guide.\n\n\nTemplates\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTemplates are similar to layouts in that they wrap each child layout or page. Unlike layouts that persist across routes and maintain state, templates create a new instance for each of their children on navigation. This means that when a user navigates between routes that share a template, a new instance of the component is mounted, DOM elements are recreated, state is not preserved, and effects are re-synchronized.\nThere may be cases where you need those specific behaviors, and templates would be a more suitable option than layouts. For example:\n\nFeatures that rely on useEffect (e.g logging page views) and useState (e.g a per-page feedback form).\nTo change the default framework behavior. For example, Suspense Boundaries inside layouts only show the fallback the first time the Layout is loaded and not when switching pages. For templates, the fallback is shown on each navigation.\n\nA template can be defined by exporting a default React component from a template.js file. The component should accept a children prop.\n\napp/template.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Template({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return <div>{children}</div>\n}\n\nIn terms of nesting, template.js is rendered between a layout and its children. Here's a simplified output:\nOutput<Layout>\n  {/* Note that the template is given a unique key. */}\n  <Template key={routeParam}>{children}</Template>\n</Layout>\nMetadata\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the app directory, you can modify the <head> HTML elements such as title and meta using the Metadata APIs.\nMetadata can be defined by exporting a metadata object or generateMetadata function in a layout.js or page.js file.\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Next.js',\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...'\n}\n\n\nGood to know: You should not manually add <head> tags such as <title> and <meta> to root layouts. Instead, you should use the Metadata API which automatically handles advanced requirements such as streaming and de-duplicating <head> elements.\n\nLearn more about available metadata options in the API reference"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_parallel-routes.txt","text":"Parallel RoutesParallel Routes allows you to simultaneously or conditionally render one or more pages within the same layout. They are useful for highly dynamic sections of an app, such as dashboards and feeds on social sites.\nFor example, considering a dashboard, you can use parallel routes to simultaneously render the team and analytics pages:\n\nSlots\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nParallel routes are created using named slots. Slots are defined with the @folder convention. For example, the following file structure defines two slots: @analytics and @team:\n\nSlots are passed as props to the shared parent layout. For the example above, the component in app/layout.js now accepts the @analytics and @team slots props, and can render them in parallel alongside the children prop:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Layout({\n  children,\n  team,\n  analytics,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  analytics: React.ReactNode\n  team: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      {children}\n      {team}\n      {analytics}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nHowever, slots are not route segments and do not affect the URL structure. For example, for /@analytics/views, the URL will be /views since @analytics is a slot.\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe children prop is an implicit slot that does not need to be mapped to a folder. This means app/page.js is equivalent to app/@children/page.js.\n\n\nActive state and navigation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, Next.js keeps track of the active state (or subpage) for each slot. However, the content rendered within a slot will depend on the type of navigation:\n\nSoft Navigation: During client-side navigation, Next.js will perform a partial render, changing the subpage within the slot, while maintaining the other slot's active subpages, even if they don't match the current URL.\nHard Navigation: After a full-page load (browser refresh), Next.js cannot determine the active state for the slots that don't match the current URL. Instead, it will render a default.js file for the unmatched slots, or 404 if default.js doesn't exist.\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe 404 for unmatched routes helps ensure that you don't accidentally render a parallel route on a page that it was not intended for.\n\n\ndefault.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can define a default.js file to render as a fallback for unmatched slots during the initial load or full-page reload.\nConsider the following folder structure. The @team slot has a /settings page, but @analytics does not.\n\nWhen navigating to /settings, the @team slot will render the /settings page while maintaining the currently active page for the @analytics slot.\nOn refresh, Next.js will render a default.js for @analytics. If default.js doesn't exist, a 404 is rendered instead.\nAdditionally, since children is an implicit slot, you also need to create a default.js file to render a fallback for children when Next.js cannot recover the active state of the parent page.\nuseSelectedLayoutSegment(s)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBoth useSelectedLayoutSegment and useSelectedLayoutSegments accept a parallelRoutesKey parameter, which allows you to read the active route segment within a slot.\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function Layout({ auth }: { auth: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const loginSegment = useSelectedLayoutSegment('auth')\n  // ...\n}\n\nWhen a user navigates to app/@auth/login (or /login in the URL bar), loginSegment will be equal to the string \"login\".\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nConditional Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use Parallel Routes to conditionally render routes based on certain conditions, such as user role. For example, to render a different dashboard page for the /admin or /user roles:\n\napp/dashboard/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { checkUserRole } from '@/lib/auth'\n \nexport default function Layout({\n  user,\n  admin,\n}: {\n  user: React.ReactNode\n  admin: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  const role = checkUserRole()\n  return <>{role === 'admin' ? admin : user}</>\n}\n\nTab Groups\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can add a layout inside a slot to allow users to navigate the slot independently. This is useful for creating tabs.\nFor example, the @analytics slot has two subpages: /page-views and /visitors.\n\nWithin @analytics, create a layout file to share the tabs between the two pages:\napp/@analytics/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Link href=\"/page-views\">Page Views</Link>\n        <Link href=\"/visitors\">Visitors</Link>\n      </nav>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nModals\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nParallel Routes can be used together with Intercepting Routes to create modals. This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:\n\nMaking the modal content shareable through a URL.\nPreserving context when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.\nClosing the modal on backwards navigation rather than going to the previous route.\nReopening the modal on forwards navigation.\n\nConsider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a login modal from a layout using client-side navigation, or access a separate /login page:\n\nTo implement this pattern, start by creating a /login route that renders your main login page.\n\napp/login/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Login } from '@/app/ui/login'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Login />\n}\n\nThen, inside the @auth slot, add default.js file that returns null. This ensures that the modal is not rendered when it's not active.\napp/@auth/default.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Default() {\n  return null\n}\n\nInside your @auth slot, intercept the /login route by updating the /(.)login folder. Import the <Modal> component and its children into the /(.)login/page.tsx file:\napp/@auth/(.)login/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Modal } from '@/app/ui/modal'\nimport { Login } from '@/app/ui/login'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Modal>\n      <Login />\n    </Modal>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe convention used to intercept the route, e.g. (.), depends on your file-system structure. See Intercepting Routes convention.\nBy separating the <Modal> functionality from the modal content (<Login>), you can ensure any content inside the modal, e.g. forms, are Server Components. See Interleaving Client and Server Components for more information.\n\n\nOpening the modal\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNow, you can leverage the Next.js router to open and close the modal. This ensures the URL is correctly updated when the modal is open, and when navigating backwards and forwards.\nTo open the modal, pass the @auth slot as a prop to the parent layout and render it alongside the children prop.\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Layout({\n  auth,\n  children,\n}: {\n  auth: React.ReactNode\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Link href=\"/login\">Open modal</Link>\n      </nav>\n      <div>{auth}</div>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nWhen the user clicks the <Link>, the modal will open instead of navigating to the /login page. However, on refresh or initial load, navigating to /login will take the user to the main login page.\nClosing the modal\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can close the modal by calling router.back() or by using the Link component.\napp/ui/modal.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          router.back()\n        }}\n      >\n        Close modal\n      </button>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nWhen using the Link component to navigate away from a page that shouldn't render the @auth slot anymore, we use a catch-all route that returns null.\napp/ui/modal.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Close modal</Link>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\napp/@auth/[...catchAll]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function CatchAll() {\n  return null\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nWe use a catch-all route in our @auth slot to close the modal because of the behavior described in Active state and navigation. Since client-side navigations to a route that no longer match the slot will remain visible, we need to match the slot to a route that returns null to close the modal.\nOther examples could include opening a photo modal in a gallery while also having a dedicated /photo/[id] page, or opening a shopping cart in a side modal.\nView an example of modals with Intercepted and Parallel Routes.\n\n\nLoading and Error UI\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nParallel Routes can be streamed independently, allowing you to define independent error and loading states for each route:\n\nSee the Loading UI and Error Handling documentation for more information."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_redirecting.txt","text":"RedirectingThere are a few ways you can handle redirects in Next.js.

For example:app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nIf you don't need to programmatically navigate a user, you should use a <Link> component.\n\n\nSee the useRouter API reference for more information.\n\nredirects in next.config.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe redirects option in the next.config.js file allows you to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path. This is useful when you change the URL structure of pages or have a list of redirects that are known ahead of time.\nredirects supports path, header, cookie, and query matching, giving you the flexibility to redirect users based on an incoming request.\nTo use redirects, add the option to your next.config.js file:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      // Basic redirect\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        destination: '/',\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n      // Wildcard path matching\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        destination: '/news/:slug',\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nSee the redirects API reference for more information.\n\nGood to know:\n\nredirects can return a 307 (Temporary Redirect) or 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code with the permanent option.\nredirects may have a limit on platforms. For example, on Vercel, there's a limit of 1,024 redirects. To manage a large number of redirects (1000+), consider creating a custom solution using Middleware. See managing redirects at scale for more.\nredirects runs before Middleware.\n\n\nNextResponse.redirect in Middleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, redirect to a different URL using NextResponse.redirect. This is useful if you want to redirect users based on a condition (e.g. authentication, session management, etc) or have a large number of redirects.\nFor example, to redirect the user to a /login page if they are not authenticated:\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { authenticate } from 'auth-provider'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const isAuthenticated = authenticate(request)\n \n  // If the user is authenticated, continue as normal\n  if (isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.next()\n  }\n \n  // Redirect to login page if not authenticated\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/dashboard/:path*',\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nMiddleware runs after redirects in next.config.js and before rendering.\n\n\nSee the Middleware documentation for more information.\nManaging redirects at scale (advanced)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo manage a large number of redirects (1000+), you may consider creating a custom solution using Middleware. This allows you to handle redirects programmatically without having to redeploy your application.\nTo do this, you'll need to consider:\n\nCreating and storing a redirect map.\nOptimizing data lookup performance.\n\n\nNext.js Example: See our Middleware with Bloom filter example for an implementation of the recommendations below.\n\n1. Creating and storing a redirect map\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA redirect map is a list of redirects that you can store in a database (usually a key-value store) or JSON file.\nConsider the following data structure:\n{\n  \"/old\": {\n    \"destination\": \"/new\",\n    \"permanent\": true\n  },\n  \"/blog/post-old\": {\n    \"destination\": \"/blog/post-new\",\n    \"permanent\": true\n  }\n}\nIn Middleware, you can read from a database such as Vercel's Edge Config or Redis, and redirect the user based on the incoming request:\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { get } from '@vercel/edge-config'\n \ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n \nexport async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname\n  const redirectData = await get(pathname)\n \n  if (redirectData && typeof redirectData === 'string') {\n    const redirectEntry: RedirectEntry = JSON.parse(redirectData)\n    const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307\n    return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)\n  }\n \n  // No redirect found, continue without redirecting\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n\n2. Optimizing data lookup performance\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nReading a large dataset for every incoming request can be slow and expensive. There are two ways you can optimize data lookup performance:\n\nUse a database that is optimized for fast reads, such as Vercel Edge Config or Redis.\nUse a data lookup strategy such as a Bloom filter to efficiently check if a redirect exists before reading the larger redirects file or database.\n\nConsidering the previous example, you can import a generated bloom filter file into Middleware, then, check if the incoming request pathname exists in the bloom filter.\nIf it does, forward the request to a Route Handler  which will check the actual file and redirect the user to the appropriate URL. This avoids importing a large redirects file into Middleware, which can slow down every incoming request.\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { ScalableBloomFilter } from 'bloom-filters'\nimport GeneratedBloomFilter from './redirects/bloom-filter.json'\n \ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n \n// Initialize bloom filter from a generated JSON file\nconst bloomFilter = ScalableBloomFilter.fromJSON(GeneratedBloomFilter as any)\n \nexport async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Get the path for the incoming request\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname\n \n  // Check if the path is in the bloom filter\n  if (bloomFilter.has(pathname)) {\n    // Forward the pathname to the Route Handler\n    const api = new URL(\n      `/api/redirects?pathname=${encodeURIComponent(request.nextUrl.pathname)}`,\n      request.nextUrl.origin\n    )\n \n    try {\n      // Fetch redirect data from the Route Handler\n      const redirectData = await fetch(api)\n \n      if (redirectData.ok) {\n        const redirectEntry: RedirectEntry | undefined =\n          await redirectData.json()\n \n        if (redirectEntry) {\n          // Determine the status code\n          const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307\n \n          // Redirect to the destination\n          return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)\n        }\n      }\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(error)\n    }\n  }\n \n  // No redirect found, continue the request without redirecting\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n\nThen, in the Route Handler:app/redirects/route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport redirects from '@/app/redirects/redirects.json'\n \ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n \nexport function GET(request: NextRequest) {\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('pathname')\n  if (!pathname) {\n    return new Response('Bad Request', { status: 400 })\n  }\n \n  // Get the redirect entry from the redirects.json file\n  const redirect = (redirects as Record<string, RedirectEntry>)[pathname]\n \n  // Account for bloom filter false positives\n  if (!redirect) {\n    return new Response('No redirect', { status: 400 })\n  }\n \n  // Return the redirect entry\n  return NextResponse.json(redirect)\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nTo generate a bloom filter, you can use a library like bloom-filters.\nYou should validate requests made to your Route Handler to prevent malicious requests.\n\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_route-groups.txt","text":"Route GroupsIn the app directory, nested folders are normally mapped to URL paths. However, you can mark a folder as a Route Group to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.\nThis allows you to organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.\nRoute groups are useful for:\n\nOrganizing routes into groups e.g. by site section, intent, or team.\nEnabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:\n\nCreating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts\nAdding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment\n\n\n\nConvention\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in parenthesis: (folderName)\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOrganize routes without affecting the URL path\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo organize routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. (marketing) or (shop)).\n\nEven though routes inside (marketing) and (shop) share the same URL hierarchy, you can create a different layout for each group by adding a layout.js file inside their folders.\n\nOpting specific segments into a layout\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo opt specific routes into a layout, create a new route group (e.g. (shop)) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. account and cart). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. checkout).\n\nCreating multiple root layouts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo create multiple root layouts, remove the top-level layout.js file, and add a layout.js file inside each route groups. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The <html> and <body> tags need to be added to each root layout.\n\nIn the example above, both (marketing) and (shop) have their own root layout.\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe naming of route groups has no special significance other than for organization. They do not affect the URL path.\nRoutes that include a route group should not resolve to the same URL path as other routes. For example, since route groups don't affect URL structure, (marketing)/about/page.js and (shop)/about/page.js would both resolve to /about and cause an error.\nIf you use multiple root layouts without a top-level layout.js file, your home page.js file should be defined in one of the route groups, For example: app/(marketing)/page.js.\nNavigating across multiple root layouts will cause a full page load (as opposed to a client-side navigation). For example, navigating from /cart that uses app/(shop)/layout.js to /blog that uses app/(marketing)/layout.js will cause a full page load. This only applies to multiple root layouts.\n\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_routing_route-handlers.txt","text":"Route HandlersRoute Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web Request and Response APIs.\n\n\nGood to know: Route Handlers are only available inside the app directory.

If you use a lower TypeScript version, you can use NextResponse.json() for typed responses instead.\n\nOpting out of caching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can opt out of caching by:\n\nUsing the Request object with the GET method.\nUsing any of the other HTTP methods.\nUsing Dynamic Functions like cookies and headers.\nThe Segment Config Options manually specifies dynamic mode.\n\nFor example:\napp/products/api/route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)\n  const id = searchParams.get('id')\n  const res = await fetch(`https://data.mongodb-api.com/product/${id}`, {\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'API-Key': process.env.DATA_API_KEY!,\n    },\n  })\n  const product = await res.json()\n \n  return Response.json({ product })\n}\n\nSimilarly, the POST method will cause the Route Handler to be evaluated dynamically.\napp/items/route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport async function POST() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://data.mongodb-api.com/...', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'API-Key': process.env.DATA_API_KEY!,\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({ time: new Date().toISOString() }),\n  })\n \n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  return Response.json(data)\n}\n\n\nGood to know: Like API Routes, Route Handlers can be used for cases like handling form submissions.

This ensures the style rules are placed before any content that might use them. In the future, we may use an upcoming React feature to determine where to inject the styles.\nDuring streaming, styles from each chunk will be collected and appended to existing styles. After client-side hydration is complete, styled-components will take over as usual and inject any further dynamic styles.\nWe specifically use a Client Component at the top level of the tree for the style registry because it's more efficient to extract CSS rules this way. It avoids re-generating styles on subsequent server renders, and prevents them from being sent in the Server Component payload.\nFor advanced use cases where you need to configure individual properties of styled-components compilation, you can read our Next.js styled-components API reference to learn more.\n\n\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_styling_css-modules.txt","text":"CSS Modules and Global Styles\n\nNext.js supports different types of stylesheets, including:\n\nCSS Modules\nGlobal Styles\nExternal Stylesheets\n\nCSS Modules\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has built-in support for CSS Modules using the .module.css extension.\nCSS Modules locally scope CSS by automatically creating a unique class name.

This behavior makes CSS Modules the ideal way to include component-level CSS.\nExample\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCSS Modules can be imported into any file inside the app directory:app/dashboard/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport styles from './styles.module.css'\n \nexport default function DashboardLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return <section className={styles.dashboard}>{children}</section>\n}app/dashboard/styles.module.css.dashboard {\n  padding: 24px;\n}\n\nCSS Modules are only enabled for files with the .module.css and .module.sass extensions.\nIn production, all CSS Module files will be automatically concatenated into many minified and code-split .css files.\nThese .css files represent hot execution paths in your application, ensuring the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for your application to paint.\nGlobal Styles\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nGlobal styles can be imported into any layout, page, or component inside the app directory.\nGood to know: This is different from the pages directory, where you can only import global styles inside the _app.js file.\nFor example, consider a stylesheet named app/global.css:body {\n  padding: 20px 20px 60px;\n  max-width: 680px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}Inside the root layout (app/layout.js), import the global.css stylesheet to apply the styles to every route in your application:app/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// These styles apply to every route in the application\nimport './global.css'\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nExternal Stylesheets\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nStylesheets published by external packages can be imported anywhere in the app directory, including colocated components:app/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body className=\"container\">{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\nGood to know: External stylesheets must be directly imported from an npm package or downloaded and colocated with your codebase. You cannot use <link rel=\"stylesheet\" />.\n\n\nOrdering and Merging\n  \n    \n    \n  \nNext.js optimizes CSS during production builds by automatically chunking (merging) stylesheets. The CSS order is determined by the order in which you import the stylesheets into your application code.For example, base-button.module.css will be ordered before page.module.css since <BaseButton> is imported first in <Page>:base-button.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport styles from './base-button.module.css'\n \nexport function BaseButton() {\n  return <button className={styles.primary} />\n}page.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { BaseButton } from './base-button'\nimport styles from './page.module.css'\n \nexport function Page() {\n  return <BaseButton className={styles.primary} />\n}To maintain a predictable order, we recommend the following:\nOnly import a CSS file in a single JS/TS file.\n\nIf using global class names, import the global styles in the same file in the order you want them to be applied.\n\n\nPrefer CSS Modules over global styles.\n\nUse a consistent naming convention for your CSS modules. For example, using <name>.module.css over <name>.tsx.\n\n\nExtract shared styles into a separate shared component.\nIf using Tailwind, import the stylesheet at the top of the file, preferably in the Root Layout.\n\nGood to know: CSS ordering behaves differently in development mode, always ensure to check preview deployments to verify the final CSS order in your production build.\n\nAdditional Features\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js includes additional features to improve the authoring experience of adding styles:\n\nWhen running locally with next dev, local stylesheets (either global or CSS modules) will take advantage of Fast Refresh to instantly reflect changes as edits are saved.\nWhen building for production with next build, CSS files will be bundled into fewer minified .css files to reduce the number of network requests needed to retrieve styles.\nIf you disable JavaScript, styles will still be loaded in the production build (next start). However, JavaScript is still required for next dev to enable Fast Refresh.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_styling_sass.txt","text":"Sass\nNext.js has built-in support for integrating with Sass after the package is installed using both the .scss and .sass extensions.

This page provides an overview of types and commonly used tools you can use to test your application.\nTypes of tests\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nUnit testing involves testing individual units (or blocks of code) in isolation. In React, a unit can be a single function, hook, or component.\n\nComponent testing is a more focused version of unit testing where the primary subject of the tests is React components. This may involve testing how components are rendered, their interaction with props, and their behavior in response to user events.\nIntegration testing involves testing how multiple units work together. This can be a combination of components, hooks, and functions.\n\n\nEnd-to-End (E2E) Testing involves testing user flows in an environment that simulates real user scenarios, like the browser. This means testing specific tasks (e.g. signup flow) in a production-like environment.\nSnapshot testing involves capturing the rendered output of a component and saving it to a snapshot file. When tests run, the current rendered output of the component is compared against the saved snapshot. Changes in the snapshot are used to indicate unexpected changes in behavior.\n\nAsync Server Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \nSince async Server Components are new to the React ecosystem, some tools do not fully support them. In the meantime, we recommend using End-to-End Testing over Unit Testing for async components.\nGuides\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSee the guides below to learn how to set up Next.js with these commonly used testing tools:"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_testing_cypress.txt","text":"Setting up Cypress with Next.jsCypress is a test runner used for End-to-End (E2E) and Component Testing.

For more information, please see Test Environment Variables.\n\n\nOptional: Handling Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf your project is using Module Path Aliases, you will need to configure Jest to resolve the imports by matching the paths option in the jsconfig.json file with the moduleNameMapper option in the jest.config.js file. For example:\ntsconfig.json or jsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\njest.config.jsmoduleNameMapper: {\n  // ...\n  '^@/components/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/components/$1',\n}\nOptional: Extend Jest with custom matchers\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n@testing-library/jest-dom includes a set of convenient custom matchers such as .toBeInTheDocument() making it easier to write tests. You can import the custom matchers for every test by adding the following option to the Jest configuration file:\njest.config.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptsetupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts']\n\nThen, inside jest.setup.ts, add the following import:\njest.setup.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '@testing-library/jest-dom'\n\n\nGood to know:extend-expect was removed in v6.0, so if you are using @testing-library/jest-dom before version 6, you will need to import @testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect instead.\n\nIf you need to add more setup options before each test, you can add them to the jest.setup.js file above.\nAdd a test script to package.json:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFinally, add a Jest test script to your package.json file:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"test\": \"jest\",\n    \"test:watch\": \"jest --watch\"\n  }\n}\njest --watch will re-run tests when a file is changed. For more Jest CLI options, please refer to the Jest Docs.\nCreating your first test:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYour project is now ready to run tests. Create a folder called __tests__ in your project's root directory.\n\nFor example, we can add a test to check if the <Page /> component successfully renders a heading:import Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}__tests__/page.test.jsximport '@testing-library/jest-dom'\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Page from '../app/page'\n \ndescribe('Page', () => {\n  it('renders a heading', () => {\n    render(<Page />)\n \n    const heading = screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })\n \n    expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\nOptionally, add a snapshot test to keep track of any unexpected changes in your component:\n\n__tests__/snapshot.jsimport { render } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Page from '../app/page'\n \nit('renders homepage unchanged', () => {\n  const { container } = render(<Page />)\n  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot()\n})\nRunning your tests\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThen, run the following command to run your tests:\nTerminalnpm run test\n# or\nyarn test\n# or\npnpm test\nAdditional Resources\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor further reading, you may find these resources helpful:\n\nNext.js with Jest example\nJest Docs\nReact Testing Library Docs\nTesting Playground - use good testing practices to match elements.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_testing_playwright.txt","text":"Setting up Playwright with Next.jsPlaywright is a testing framework that lets you automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API.

The new Router is available in the app directory and co-exists with the pages directory.\nUpgrading to Next.js 13 does not require using the new App Router. You can continue using pages with new features that work in both directories, such as the updated Image component, Link component, Script component, and Font optimization.\n<Image/> Component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js 12 introduced new improvements to the Image Component with a temporary import: next/future/image. These improvements included less client-side JavaScript, easier ways to extend and style images, better accessibility, and native browser lazy loading.\nIn version 13, this new behavior is now the default for next/image.\nThere are two codemods to help you migrate to the new Image Component:\n\nnext-image-to-legacy-image codemod: Safely and automatically renames next/image imports to next/legacy/image. Existing components will maintain the same behavior.\nnext-image-experimental codemod: Dangerously adds inline styles and removes unused props. This will change the behavior of existing components to match the new defaults. To use this codemod, you need to run the next-image-to-legacy-image codemod first.\n\n<Link> Component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe <Link> Component no longer requires manually adding an <a> tag as a child. This behavior was added as an experimental option in version 12.2 and is now the default. In Next.js 13, <Link> always renders <a> and allows you to forward props to the underlying tag.\nFor example:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \n// Next.js 12: `<a>` has to be nested otherwise it's excluded\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a>About</a>\n</Link>\n \n// Next.js 13: `<Link>` always renders `<a>` under the hood\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  About\n</Link>\nTo upgrade your links to Next.js 13, you can use the new-link codemod.\n<Script> Component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe behavior of next/script has been updated to support both pages and app, but some changes need to be made to ensure a smooth migration:\n\nMove any beforeInteractive scripts you previously included in _document.js to the root layout file (app/layout.tsx).\nThe experimental worker strategy does not yet work in app and scripts denoted with this strategy will either have to be removed or modified to use a different strategy (e.g. lazyOnload).\nonLoad, onReady, and onError handlers will not work in Server Components so make sure to move them to a Client Component or remove them altogether.\n\nFont Optimization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPreviously, Next.js helped you optimize fonts by inlining font CSS. Version 13 introduces the new next/font module which gives you the ability to customize your font loading experience while still ensuring great performance and privacy. next/font is supported in both the pages and app directories.\nWhile inlining CSS still works in pages, it does not work in app. You should use next/font instead.\nSee the Font Optimization page to learn how to use next/font.\nMigrating from pages to app\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n🎥 Watch: Learn how to incrementally adopt the App Router → YouTube (16 minutes).\n\nMoving to the App Router may be the first time using React features that Next.js builds on top of such as Server Components, Suspense, and more. When combined with new Next.js features such as special files and layouts, migration means new concepts, mental models, and behavioral changes to learn.\nWe recommend reducing the combined complexity of these updates by breaking down your migration into smaller steps. The app directory is intentionally designed to work simultaneously with the pages directory to allow for incremental page-by-page migration.\n\nThe app directory supports nested routes and layouts. Learn more.\nUse nested folders to define routes and a special page.js file to make a route segment publicly accessible. Learn more.\nSpecial file conventions are used to create UI for each route segment. The most common special files are page.js and layout.js.\n\nUse page.js to define UI unique to a route.\nUse layout.js to define UI that is shared across multiple routes.\n.js, .jsx, or .tsx file extensions can be used for special files.\n\n\nYou can colocate other files inside the app directory such as components, styles, tests, and more. Learn more.\nData fetching functions like getServerSideProps and getStaticProps have been replaced with a new API inside app. getStaticPaths has been replaced with generateStaticParams.\npages/_app.js and pages/_document.js have been replaced with a single app/layout.js root layout. Learn more.\npages/_error.js has been replaced with more granular error.js special files. Learn more.\npages/404.js has been replaced with the not-found.js file.\npages/api/* API Routes have been replaced with the route.js (Route Handler) special file.\n\nStep 1: Creating the app directory\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUpdate to the latest Next.js version (requires 13.4 or greater):\nnpm install next@latest\nThen, create a new app directory at the root of your project (or src/ directory).\nStep 2: Creating a Root Layout\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCreate a new app/layout.tsx file inside the app directory. This is a root layout that will apply to all routes inside app.\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  // Layouts must accept a children prop.\n  // This will be populated with nested layouts or pages\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nThe app directory must include a root layout.\nThe root layout must define <html>, and <body> tags since Next.js does not automatically create them\nThe root layout replaces the pages/_app.tsx and pages/_document.tsx files.\n.js, .jsx, or .tsx extensions can be used for layout files.\n\nTo manage <head> HTML elements, you can use the built-in SEO support:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Home',\n  description: 'Welcome to Next.js',\n}\n\nMigrating _document.js and _app.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you have an existing _app or _document file, you can copy the contents (e.g. global styles) to the root layout (app/layout.tsx). Styles in app/layout.tsx will not apply to pages/*. You should keep _app/_document while migrating to prevent your pages/* routes from breaking. Once fully migrated, you can then safely delete them.\nIf you are using any React Context providers, they will need to be moved to a Client Component.\nMigrating the getLayout() pattern to Layouts (Optional)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js recommended adding a property to Page components to achieve per-page layouts in the pages directory. This pattern can be replaced with native support for nested layouts in the app directory.\nSee before and after exampleBeforecomponents/DashboardLayout.jsexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>My Dashboard</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}pages/dashboard/index.jsimport DashboardLayout from '../components/DashboardLayout'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <p>My Page</p>\n}\n \nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {\n  return <DashboardLayout>{page}</DashboardLayout>\n}After\n\nRemove the Page.getLayout property from pages/dashboard/index.js and follow the steps for migrating pages to the app directory.\napp/dashboard/page.jsexport default function Page() {\n  return <p>My Page</p>\n}\n\n\nMove the contents of DashboardLayout into a new Client Component to retain pages directory behavior.\napp/dashboard/DashboardLayout.js'use client' // this directive should be at top of the file, before any imports.\n \n// This is a Client Component\nexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>My Dashboard</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\n\nImport the DashboardLayout into a new layout.js file inside the app directory.\napp/dashboard/layout.jsimport DashboardLayout from './DashboardLayout'\n \n// This is a Server Component\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return <DashboardLayout>{children}</DashboardLayout>\n}\n\n\nYou can incrementally move non-interactive parts of DashboardLayout.js (Client Component) into layout.js (Server Component) to reduce the amount of component JavaScript you send to the client.\n\n\nStep 3: Migrating next/head\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, the next/head React component is used to manage <head> HTML elements such as title and meta . In the app directory, next/head is replaced with the new built-in SEO support.\nBefore:\npages/index.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Head from 'next/head'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>My page title</title>\n      </Head>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nAfter:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'My Page Title',\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...'\n}\n\nSee all metadata options.\nStep 4: Migrating Pages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nPages in the app directory are Server Components by default. This is different from the pages directory where pages are Client Components.\nData fetching has changed in app. getServerSideProps, getStaticProps and getInitialProps have been replaced with a simpler API.\nThe app directory uses nested folders to define routes and a special page.js file to make a route segment publicly accessible.\n\npages Directoryapp DirectoryRouteindex.jspage.js/about.jsabout/page.js/aboutblog/[slug].jsblog/[slug]/page.js/blog/post-1\n\n\nWe recommend breaking down the migration of a page into two main steps:\n\nStep 1: Move the default exported Page Component into a new Client Component.\nStep 2: Import the new Client Component into a new page.js file inside the app directory.\n\n\nGood to know: This is the easiest migration path because it has the most comparable behavior to the pages directory.\n\nStep 1: Create a new Client Component\n\nCreate a new separate file inside the app directory (i.e. app/home-page.tsx or similar) that exports a Client Component. To define Client Components, add the 'use client' directive to the top of the file (before any imports).\n\nSimilar to the Pages Router, there is an optimization step to prerender Client Components to static HTML on the initial page load.\n\n\nMove the default exported page component from pages/index.js to app/home-page.tsx.\n\napp/home-page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \n// This is a Client Component (same as components in the `pages` directory)\n// It receives data as props, has access to state and effects, and is\n// prerendered on the server during the initial page load.\nexport default function HomePage({ recentPosts }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {recentPosts.map((post) => (\n        <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nStep 2: Create a new page\n\n\nCreate a new app/page.tsx file inside the app directory. This is a Server Component by default.\n\n\nImport the home-page.tsx Client Component into the page.\n\n\nIf you were fetching data in pages/index.js, move the data fetching logic directly into the Server Component using the new data fetching APIs. See the data fetching upgrade guide for more details.\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// Import your Client Component\nimport HomePage from './home-page'\n \nasync function getPosts() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n  return posts\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  // Fetch data directly in a Server Component\n  const recentPosts = await getPosts()\n  // Forward fetched data to your Client Component\n  return <HomePage recentPosts={recentPosts} />\n}\n\n\n\nIf your previous page used useRouter, you'll need to update to the new routing hooks. Learn more.\n\n\nStart your development server and visit http://localhost:3000. You should see your existing index route, now served through the app directory.\n\n\nStep 5: Migrating Routing Hooks\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA new router has been added to support the new behavior in the app directory.\nIn app, you should use the three new hooks imported from next/navigation: useRouter(), usePathname(), and useSearchParams().\n\nThe new useRouter hook is imported from next/navigation and has different behavior to the useRouter hook in pages which is imported from next/router.\n\nThe useRouter hook imported from next/router is not supported in the app directory but can continue to be used in the pages directory.\n\n\nThe new useRouter does not return the pathname string. Use the separate usePathname hook instead.\nThe new useRouter does not return the query object. Use the separate useSearchParams hook instead.\nYou can use useSearchParams and usePathname together to listen to page changes. See the Router Events section for more details.\nThese new hooks are only supported in Client Components. They cannot be used in Server Components.\n\napp/example-client-component.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useRouter, usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function ExampleClientComponent() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  // ...\n}\n\nIn addition, the new useRouter hook has the following changes:\n\nisFallback has been removed because fallback has been replaced.\nThe locale, locales, defaultLocales, domainLocales values have been removed because built-in i18n Next.js features are no longer necessary in the app directory. Learn more about i18n.\nbasePath has been removed. The alternative will not be part of useRouter. It has not yet been implemented.\nasPath has been removed because the concept of as has been removed from the new router.\nisReady has been removed because it is no longer necessary. During static rendering, any component that uses the useSearchParams() hook will skip the prerendering step and instead be rendered on the client at runtime.\n\nView the useRouter() API reference.\nStep 6: Migrating Data Fetching Methods\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe pages directory uses getServerSideProps and getStaticProps to fetch data for pages. Inside the app directory, these previous data fetching functions are replaced with a simpler API built on top of fetch() and async React Server Components.\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default async function Page() {\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\n \n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n \n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  })\n \n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n\nServer-side Rendering (getServerSideProps)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, getServerSideProps is used to fetch data on the server and forward props to the default exported React component in the file. The initial HTML for the page is prerendered from the server, followed by \"hydrating\" the page in the browser (making it interactive).\npages/dashboard.js// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n \nexport default function Dashboard({ projects }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\nIn the app directory, we can colocate our data fetching inside our React components using Server Components. This allows us to send less JavaScript to the client, while maintaining the rendered HTML from the server.\nBy setting the cache option to no-store, we can indicate that the fetched data should never be cached. This is similar to getServerSideProps in the pages directory.\napp/dashboard/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// `app` directory\n \n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return projects\n}\n \nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n \n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n\nAccessing Request Object\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, you can retrieve request-based data based on the Node.js HTTP API.\nFor example, you can retrieve the req object from getServerSideProps and use it to retrieve the request's cookies and headers.\npages/index.js// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getServerSideProps({ req, query }) {\n  const authHeader = req.getHeaders()['authorization'];\n  const theme = req.cookies['theme'];\n \n  return { props: { ... }}\n}\n \nexport default function Page(props) {\n  return ...\n}\nThe app directory exposes new read-only functions to retrieve request data:\n\nheaders(): Based on the Web Headers API, and can be used inside Server Components to retrieve request headers.\ncookies(): Based on the Web Cookies API, and can be used inside Server Components to retrieve cookies.\n\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// `app` directory\nimport { cookies, headers } from 'next/headers'\n \nasync function getData() {\n  const authHeader = headers().get('authorization')\n \n  return '...'\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  // You can use `cookies()` or `headers()` inside Server Components\n  // directly or in your data fetching function\n  const theme = cookies().get('theme')\n  const data = await getData()\n  return '...'\n}\n\nStatic Site Generation (getStaticProps)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, the getStaticProps function is used to pre-render a page at build time. This function can be used to fetch data from an external API or directly from a database, and pass this data down to the entire page as it's being generated during the build.\npages/index.js// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n \nexport default function Index({ projects }) {\n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\n}\nIn the app directory, data fetching with fetch() will default to cache: 'force-cache', which will cache the request data until manually invalidated. This is similar to getStaticProps in the pages directory.\napp/page.js// `app` directory\n \n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return projects\n}\n \nexport default async function Index() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n \n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\n}\nDynamic paths (getStaticPaths)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, the getStaticPaths function is used to define the dynamic paths that should be pre-rendered at build time.\npages/posts/[id].js// `pages` directory\nimport PostLayout from '@/components/post-layout'\n \nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [{ params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }],\n  }\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n \nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return <PostLayout post={post} />\n}\nIn the app directory, getStaticPaths is replaced with generateStaticParams.\ngenerateStaticParams behaves similarly to getStaticPaths, but has a simplified API for returning route parameters and can be used inside layouts. The return shape of generateStaticParams is an array of segments instead of an array of nested param objects or a string of resolved paths.\napp/posts/[id]/page.js// `app` directory\nimport PostLayout from '@/components/post-layout'\n \nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ id: '1' }, { id: '2' }]\n}\n \nasync function getPost(params) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  return post\n}\n \nexport default async function Post({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params)\n \n  return <PostLayout post={post} />\n}\nUsing the name generateStaticParams is more appropriate than getStaticPaths for the new model in the app directory. The get prefix is replaced with a more descriptive generate, which sits better alone now that getStaticProps and getServerSideProps are no longer necessary. The Paths suffix is replaced by Params, which is more appropriate for nested routing with multiple dynamic segments.\n\nReplacing fallback\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, the fallback property returned from getStaticPaths is used to define the behavior of a page that isn't pre-rendered at build time. This property can be set to true to show a fallback page while the page is being generated, false to show a 404 page, or blocking to generate the page at request time.\npages/posts/[id].js// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [],\n    fallback: 'blocking'\n  };\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  ...\n}\n \nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return ...\n}\nIn the app directory the config.dynamicParams property controls how params outside of generateStaticParams are handled:\n\ntrue: (default) Dynamic segments not included in generateStaticParams are generated on demand.\nfalse: Dynamic segments not included in generateStaticParams will return a 404.\n\nThis replaces the fallback: true | false | 'blocking' option of getStaticPaths in the pages directory. The fallback: 'blocking' option is not included in dynamicParams because the difference between 'blocking' and true is negligible with streaming.\napp/posts/[id]/page.js// `app` directory\n \nexport const dynamicParams = true;\n \nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [...]\n}\n \nasync function getPost(params) {\n  ...\n}\n \nexport default async function Post({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params);\n \n  return ...\n}\nWith dynamicParams set to true (the default), when a route segment is requested that hasn't been generated, it will be server-rendered and cached.\nIncremental Static Regeneration (getStaticProps with revalidate)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, the getStaticProps function allows you to add a revalidate field to automatically regenerate a page after a certain amount of time.\npages/index.js// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`)\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  return {\n    props: { posts },\n    revalidate: 60,\n  }\n}\n \nexport default function Index({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <PostList posts={posts} />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\nIn the app directory, data fetching with fetch() can use revalidate, which will cache the request for the specified amount of seconds.\napp/page.js// `app` directory\n \nasync function getPosts() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`, { next: { revalidate: 60 } })\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  return data.posts\n}\n \nexport default async function PostList() {\n  const posts = await getPosts()\n \n  return posts.map((post) => <div>{post.name}</div>)\n}\nAPI Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAPI Routes continue to work in the pages/api directory without any changes.

Client-side only applications, also known as single-page applications (SPAs), often experience slow initial page loading time. This happens due to a couple of reasons:\n\nThe browser needs to wait for the React code and your entire application bundle to download and run before your code is able to send requests to load data.\nYour application code grows with every new feature and dependency you add.\n\nNo automatic code splitting\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe previous issue of slow loading times can be somewhat managed with code splitting. However, if you try to do code splitting manually, you'll often make performance worse. It's easy to inadvertently introduce network waterfalls when code-splitting manually. Next.js provides automatic code splitting built into its router.\nNetwork waterfalls\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA common cause of poor performance occurs when applications make sequential client-server requests to fetch data. One common pattern for data fetching in an SPA is to initially render a placeholder, and then fetch data after the component has mounted. Unfortunately, this means that a child component that fetches data can't start fetching until the parent component has finished loading its own data.\nWhile fetching data on the client is supported with Next.js, it also gives you the option to shift data fetching to the server, which can eliminate client-server waterfalls.\nFast and intentional loading states\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWith built-in support for streaming through React Suspense, you can be more intentional about which parts of your UI you want to load first and in what order without introducing network waterfalls.\nThis enables you to build pages that are faster to load and eliminate layout shifts.\nChoose the data fetching strategy\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDepending on your needs, Next.js allows you to choose your data fetching strategy on a page and component basis. You can decide to fetch at build time, at request time on the server, or on the client. For example, you can fetch data from your CMS and render your blog posts at build time, which can then be efficiently cached on a CDN.\nMiddleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js Middleware allows you to run code on the server before a request is completed. This is especially useful to avoid having a flash of unauthenticated content when the user visits an authenticated-only page by redirecting the user to a login page. The middleware is also useful for experimentation and internationalization.\nBuilt-in Optimizations\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nImages, fonts, and third-party scripts often have significant impact on an application's performance. Next.js comes with built-in components that automatically optimize those for you.\nMigration Steps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOur goal with this migration is to get a working Next.js application as quickly as possible, so that you can then adopt Next.js features incrementally. To begin with, we'll keep it as a purely client-side application (SPA) without migrating your existing router. This helps minimize the chances of encountering issues during the migration process and reduces merge conflicts.\nStep 1: Install the Next.js Dependency\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe first thing you need to do is to install next as a dependency:\nTerminalnpm install next@latest\nStep 2: Create the Next.js Configuration File\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCreate a next.config.mjs at the root of your project. This file will hold your Next.js configuration options.\nnext.config.mjs/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './dist', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist/`.\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\nStep 3: Update TypeScript Configuration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you're using TypeScript, you need to update your tsconfig.json file with the following changes to make it compatible with Next.js:\ntsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"dom.iterable\", \"esnext\"],\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"strict\": false,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"plugins\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"next\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.tsx\",\n    \".next/types/**/*.ts\",\n    \"./dist/types/**/*.ts\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\nYou can find more information about configuring TypeScript on the Next.js docs.\nStep 4: Create the Root Layout\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA Next.js App Router application must include a root layout file, which is a React Server Component that will wrap all pages in your application. This file is defined at the top level of the app directory.\nThe closest equivalent to the root layout file in a CRA application is the index.html file, which contains your <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.\nIn this step, you'll convert your index.html file into a root layout file:\n\nCreate a new app directory in your src directory.\nCreate a new layout.tsx file inside that app directory:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return null\n}\n\n\nGood to know: .js, .jsx, or .tsx extensions can be used for Layout files.\n\nCopy the content of your index.html file into the previously created <RootLayout> component while replacing the body.div#root and body.script tags with <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know: We'll ignore the manifest file, additional iconography other than the favicon, and testing configuration, but if these are requirements, Next.js also supports these options.\n\nStep 5: Metadata\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js already includes by default the meta charset and meta viewport tags, so you can safely remove those from your <head>:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nAny metadata files such as favicon.ico, icon.png, robots.txt are automatically added to the application <head> tag as long as you have them placed into the top level of the app directory. After moving all supported files into the app directory you can safely delete their <link> tags:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nFinally, Next.js can manage your last <head> tags with the Metadata API. Move your final metadata info into an exported metadata object:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'React App',\n  description: 'Web site created with Next.js.',\n}\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nWith the above changes, you shifted from declaring everything in your index.html to using Next.js' convention-based approach built into the framework (Metadata API). This approach enables you to more easily improve your SEO and web shareability of your pages.\nStep 6: Styles\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nLike Create React App, Next.js has built-in support for CSS Modules.\nIf you're using a global CSS file, import it into your app/layout.tsx file:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '../index.css'\n \n// ...\nIf you're using Tailwind, you'll need to install postcss and autoprefixer:\nTerminalnpm install postcss autoprefixer\nThen, create a postcss.config.js file at the root of your project:\npostcss.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss: {},\n    autoprefixer: {},\n  },\n}\nStep 7: Create the Entrypoint Page\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOn Next.js you declare an entrypoint for your application by creating a page.tsx file. The closest equivalent of this file on CRA is your src/index.tsx file. In this step, you’ll set up the entry point of your application.\nCreate a [[...slug]] directory in your app directory.\nSince this guide is aiming to first set up our Next.js as an SPA (Single Page Application), you need your page entry point to catch all possible routes of your application. For that, create a new [[...slug]] directory in your app directory.\nThis directory is what is called an optional catch-all route segment. Next.js uses a file-system based router where directories are used to define routes. This special directory will make sure that all routes of your application will be directed to its containing page.tsx file.\nCreate a new page.tsx file inside the app/[[...slug]] directory with the following content:\napp/[[...slug]]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '../../index.css'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n\nThis file is a Server Component. When you run next build, the file is prerendered into a static asset. It does not require any dynamic code.\nThis file imports our global CSS and tells generateStaticParams we are only going to generate one route, the index route at /.\nNow, let's move the rest of our CRA application which will run client-only.\napp/[[...slug]]/client.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport React from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n \nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n\nThis file is a Client Component, defined by the 'use client' directive. Client Components are still prerendered to HTML on the server before being sent to the client.\nSince we want a client-only application to start, we can configure Next.js to disable prerendering from the App component down.\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\nNow, update your entrypoint page to use the new component:\napp/[[...slug]]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '../../index.css'\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n\nStep 8: Update Static Image Imports\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js handles static image imports slightly different from CRA. With CRA, importing an image file will return its public URL as a string:\nApp.tsximport image from './img.png'\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return <img src={image} />\n}\nWith Next.js, static image imports return an object. The object can then be used directly with the Next.js <Image> component, or you can use the object's src property with your existing <img> tag.\nThe <Image> component has the added benefits of automatic image optimization. The <Image> component automatically sets the width and height attributes of the resulting <img> based on the image's dimensions. This prevents layout shifts when the image loads. However, this can cause issues if your app contains images with only one of their dimensions being styled without the other styled to auto. When not styled to auto, the dimension will default to the <img> dimension attribute's value, which can cause the image to appear distorted.\nKeeping the <img> tag will reduce the amount of changes in your application and prevent the above issues. You can then optionally later migrate to the <Image> component to take advantage of optimizing images by configuring a loader, or moving to the default Next.js server which has automatic image optimization.\nConvert absolute import paths for images imported from /public into relative imports:\n// Before\nimport logo from '/logo.png'\n \n// After\nimport logo from '../public/logo.png'\nPass the image src property instead of the whole image object to your <img> tag:\n// Before\n<img src={logo} />\n \n// After\n<img src={logo.src} />\nAlternatively, you can reference the public URL for the image asset based on the filename. For example, public/logo.png will serve the image at /logo.png for your application, which would be the src value.\n\nWarning: If you're using TypeScript, you might encounter type errors when accessing the src property. You can safely ignore those for now. They will be fixed by the end of this guide.\n\nStep 9: Migrate the Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has support for .env environment variables similar to CRA.\nThe main difference is the prefix used to expose environment variables on the client-side. Change all environment variables with the REACT_APP_ prefix to NEXT_PUBLIC_.\nStep 10: Update Scripts in package.json\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou should now be able to run your application to test if you successfully migrated to Next.js. But before that, you need to update your scripts in your package.json with Next.js related commands, and add .next, next-env.d.ts, and dist to your .gitignore file:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n.gitignore# ...\n.next\nnext-env.d.ts\ndist\nNow run npm run dev, and open http://localhost:3000. You should see your application now running on Next.js.\nStep 11: Clean Up\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can now clean up your codebase from Create React App related artifacts:\n\nDelete src/index.tsx\nDelete public/index.html\nDelete reportWebVitals setup\nUninstall CRA dependencies (react-scripts)\n\nBundler Compatibility\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCreate React App and Next.js both default to using webpack for bundling.\nWhen migrating your CRA application to Next.js, you might have a custom webpack configuration you're looking to migrate. Next.js supports providing a custom webpack configuration.\nFurther, Next.js has support for Turbopack through next dev --turbo to improve your local dev performance. Turbopack supports some webpack loaders as well for compatibility and incremental adoption.\nNext Steps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf everything went according to plan, you now have a functioning Next.js application running as a single-page application. However, you aren't yet taking advantage of most of Next.js' benefits, but you can now start making incremental changes to reap all the benefits. Here's what you might want to do next:\n\nMigrate from React Router to the Next.js App Router to get:\n\nAutomatic code splitting\nStreaming Server-Rendering\nReact Server Components\n\n\nOptimize images with the <Image> component\nOptimize fonts with next/font\nOptimize third-party scripts with the <Script> component\nUpdate your ESLint configuration to support Next.js rules\n\n\nGood to know: Using a static export does not currently support using the useParams hook.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_app_building-your-application_upgrading_from-vite.txt","text":"Migrating from ViteThis guide will help you migrate an existing Vite application to Next.js.\nWhy Switch?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are several reasons why you might want to switch from Vite to Next.js:\nSlow initial page loading time\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you have built your application with the default Vite plugin for React, your application is a purely client-side application.

Next.js provides automatic code splitting built into its router.\nNetwork waterfalls\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA common cause of poor performance occurs when applications make sequential client-server requests to fetch data. One common pattern for data fetching in an SPA is to initially render a placeholder, and then fetch data after the component has mounted. Unfortunately, this means that a child component that fetches data can't start fetching until the parent component has finished loading its own data.\nWhile fetching data on the client is supported with Next.js, it also gives you the option to shift data fetching to the server, which can eliminate client-server waterfalls.\nFast and intentional loading states\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWith built-in support for streaming through React Suspense, you can be more intentional about which parts of your UI you want to load first and in what order without introducing network waterfalls.\nThis enables you to build pages that are faster to load and eliminate layout shifts.\nChoose the data fetching strategy\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDepending on your needs, Next.js allows you to choose your data fetching strategy on a page and component basis. You can decide to fetch at build time, at request time on the server, or on the client. For example, you can fetch data from your CMS and render your blog posts at build time, which can then be efficiently cached on a CDN.\nMiddleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js Middleware allows you to run code on the server before a request is completed. This is especially useful to avoid having a flash of unauthenticated content when the user visits an authenticated-only page by redirecting the user to a login page. The middleware is also useful for experimentation and internationalization.\nBuilt-in Optimizations\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nImages, fonts, and third-party scripts often have significant impact on an application's performance. Next.js comes with built-in components that automatically optimize those for you.\nMigration Steps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOur goal with this migration is to get a working Next.js application as quickly as possible, so that\nyou can then adopt Next.js features incrementally. To begin with, we'll keep it as a purely\nclient-side application (SPA) without migrating your existing router. This helps minimize the\nchances of encountering issues during the migration process and reduces merge conflicts.\nStep 1: Install the Next.js Dependency\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe first thing you need to do is to install next as a dependency:\nTerminalnpm install next@latest\nStep 2: Create the Next.js Configuration File\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCreate a next.config.mjs at the root of your project. This file will hold your\nNext.js configuration options.\nnext.config.mjs/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './dist', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist/`.\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nGood to know: You can use either .js or .mjs for your Next.js configuration file.\n\nStep 3: Update TypeScript Configuration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you're using TypeScript, you need to update your tsconfig.json file with the following changes\nto make it compatible with Next.js. If you're not using TypeScript, you can skip this step.\n\nRemove the project reference to tsconfig.node.json\nAdd ./dist/types/**/*.ts and ./next-env.d.ts to the include array\nAdd ./node_modules to the exclude array\nAdd { \"name\": \"next\" } to the plugins array in compilerOptions: \"plugins\": [{ \"name\": \"next\" }]\nSet esModuleInterop to true: \"esModuleInterop\": true\nSet jsx to preserve: \"jsx\": \"preserve\"\nSet allowJs to true: \"allowJs\": true\nSet forceConsistentCasingInFileNames to true: \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true\nSet incremental to true: \"incremental\": true\n\nHere's an example of a working tsconfig.json with those changes:\ntsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"ES2020\",\n    \"useDefineForClassFields\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"ES2020\", \"DOM\", \"DOM.Iterable\"],\n    \"module\": \"ESNext\",\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"allowImportingTsExtensions\": true,\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noUnusedLocals\": true,\n    \"noUnusedParameters\": true,\n    \"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch\": true,\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"plugins\": [{ \"name\": \"next\" }]\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"./src\", \"./dist/types/**/*.ts\", \"./next-env.d.ts\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"./node_modules\"]\n}\nYou can find more information about configuring TypeScript on the\nNext.js docs.\nStep 4: Create the Root Layout\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA Next.js App Router application must include a\nroot layout\nfile, which is a React Server Component\nthat will wrap all pages in your application. This file is defined at the top level of the app\ndirectory.\nThe closest equivalent to the root layout file in a Vite application is the\nindex.html file, which contains your\n<html>, <head>, and <body> tags.\nIn this step, you'll convert your index.html file into a root layout file:\n\nCreate a new app directory in your src directory.\nCreate a new layout.tsx file inside that app directory:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return null\n}\n\n\nGood to know: .js, .jsx, or .tsx extensions can be used for Layout files.\n\n\nCopy the content of your index.html file into the previously created <RootLayout> component while\nreplacing the body.div#root and body.script tags with <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/icon.svg\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nNext.js already includes by default the\nmeta charset and\nmeta viewport tags, so you\ncan safely remove those from your <head>:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/icon.svg\" />\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nAny metadata files\nsuch as favicon.ico, icon.png, robots.txt are automatically added to the application\n<head> tag as long as you have them placed into the top level of the app directory. After\nmoving\nall supported files\ninto the app directory you can safely delete their <link> tags:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nFinally, Next.js can manage your last <head> tags with the\nMetadata API. Move your final metadata\ninfo into an exported\nmetadata object:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'My App',\n  description: 'My App is a...',\n}\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nWith the above changes, you shifted from declaring everything in your index.html to using Next.js'\nconvention-based approach built into the framework\n(Metadata API). This approach enables you\nto more easily improve your SEO and web shareability of your pages.\nStep 5: Create the Entrypoint Page\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOn Next.js you declare an entrypoint for your application by creating a page.tsx file. The\nclosest equivalent of this file on Vite is your main.tsx file. In this step, you’ll set up the\nentrypoint of your application.\n\nCreate a [[...slug]] directory in your app directory.\n\nSince in this guide we're aiming first to set up our Next.js as an SPA (Single Page Application),\nyou need your page entrypoint to catch all possible routes of your application. For that, create a\nnew [[...slug]] directory in your app directory.\nThis directory is what is called an\noptional catch-all route segment.\nNext.js uses a file-system based router where\ndirectories are used to define routes.\nThis special directory will make sure that all routes of your application will be directed to its\ncontaining page.tsx file.\n\nCreate a new page.tsx file inside the app/[[...slug]] directory with the following content:\n\napp/[[...slug]]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '../../index.css'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n\n\nGood to know: .js, .jsx, or .tsx extensions can be used for Page files.\n\nThis file is a Server Component. When you run next build, the file is prerendered into a static asset. It does not require any dynamic code.\nThis file imports our global CSS and tells generateStaticParams we are only going to generate one route, the index route at /.\nNow, let's move the rest of our Vite application which will run client-only.\napp/[[...slug]]/client.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport React from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n \nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n\nThis file is a Client Component, defined by the 'use client'\ndirective. Client Components are still prerendered to HTML on the server before being sent to the client.\nSince we want a client-only application to start, we can configure Next.js to disable prerendering from the App component down.\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\nNow, update your entrypoint page to use the new component:\napp/[[...slug]]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '../../index.css'\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n\nStep 6: Update Static Image Imports\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js handles static image imports slightly different from Vite. With Vite, importing an image\nfile will return its public URL as a string:\nApp.tsximport image from './img.png' // `image` will be '/assets/img.2d8efhg.png' in production\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return <img src={image} />\n}\nWith Next.js, static image imports return an object. The object can then be used directly with the\nNext.js <Image> component, or you can use the object's\nsrc property with your existing <img> tag.\nThe <Image> component has the added benefits of\nautomatic image optimization. The <Image>\ncomponent automatically sets the width and height attributes of the resulting <img> based on\nthe image's dimensions. This prevents layout shifts when the image loads. However, this can cause\nissues if your app contains images with only one of their dimensions being styled without the other\nstyled to auto. When not styled to auto, the dimension will default to the <img> dimension\nattribute's value, which can cause the image to appear distorted.\nKeeping the <img> tag will reduce the amount of changes in your application and prevent the above\nissues. You can then optionally later migrate to the <Image> component to take advantage of optimizing images by configuring a loader, or moving to the default Next.js server which has automatic image optimization.\n\nConvert absolute import paths for images imported from /public into relative imports:\n\n// Before\nimport logo from '/logo.png'\n \n// After\nimport logo from '../public/logo.png'\n\nPass the image src property instead of the whole image object to your <img> tag:\n\n// Before\n<img src={logo} />\n \n// After\n<img src={logo.src} />\nAlternatively, you can reference the public URL for the image asset based on the filename. For example, public/logo.png will serve the image at /logo.png for your application, which would be the src value.\n\nWarning: If you're using TypeScript, you might encounter type errors when accessing the src\nproperty. You can safely ignore those for now. They will be fixed by the end of this guide.\n\nStep 7: Migrate the Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has support for .env\nenvironment variables\nsimilar to Vite. The main difference is the prefix used to expose environment variables on the\nclient-side.\n\nChange all environment variables with the VITE_ prefix to NEXT_PUBLIC_.\n\nVite exposes a few built-in environment variables on the special import.meta.env object which\naren’t supported by Next.js. You need to update their usage as follows:\n\nimport.meta.env.MODE ⇒ process.env.NODE_ENV\nimport.meta.env.PROD ⇒ process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'\nimport.meta.env.DEV ⇒ process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'\nimport.meta.env.SSR ⇒ typeof window !== 'undefined'\n\nNext.js also doesn't provide a built-in BASE_URL environment variable. However, you can still\nconfigure one, if you need it:\n\nAdd the following to your .env file:\n\n.env# ...\nNEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=\"/some-base-path\"\n\nSet basePath to process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH in your next.config.mjs file:\n\nnext.config.mjs/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './dist', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist/`.\n  basePath: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH, // Sets the base path to `/some-base-path`.\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nUpdate import.meta.env.BASE_URL usages to process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH\n\nStep 8: Update Scripts in package.json\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou should now be able to run your application to test if you successfully migrated to Next.js. But\nbefore that, you need to update your scripts in your package.json with Next.js related commands,\nand add .next and next-env.d.ts to your .gitignore:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n.gitignore# ...\n.next\nnext-env.d.ts\ndist\nNow run npm run dev, and open http://localhost:3000. You should see your application now running on Next.js.\n\nExample: Check out this pull request for a\nworking example of a Vite application migrated to Next.js.\n\nStep 9: Clean Up\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can now clean up your codebase from Vite related artifacts:\n\nDelete main.tsx\nDelete index.html\nDelete vite-env.d.ts\nDelete tsconfig.node.json\nDelete vite.config.ts\nUninstall Vite dependencies\n\nNext Steps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf everything went according to plan, you now have a functioning Next.js application running as a\nsingle-page application. However, you aren't yet taking advantage of most of Next.js' benefits, but\nyou can now start making incremental changes to reap all the benefits.

Fast Refresh is enabled by default in all\nNext.js applications on 9.4 or newer. With Next.js Fast Refresh enabled,\nmost edits should be visible within a second, without losing component\nstate.\nHow It Works\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nIf you edit a file that only exports React component(s), Fast Refresh will\nupdate the code only for that file, and re-render your component. You can edit\nanything in that file, including styles, rendering logic, event handlers, or\neffects.\nIf you edit a file with exports that aren't React components, Fast Refresh\nwill re-run both that file, and the other files importing it. So if both\nButton.js and Modal.js import theme.js, editing theme.js will update\nboth components.\nFinally, if you edit a file that's imported by files outside of the\nReact tree, Fast Refresh will fall back to doing a full reload. You\nmight have a file which renders a React component but also exports a value\nthat is imported by a non-React component. For example, maybe your\ncomponent also exports a constant, and a non-React utility file imports it. In\nthat case, consider migrating the constant to a separate file and importing it\ninto both files. This will re-enable Fast Refresh to work. Other cases can\nusually be solved in a similar way.\n\nError Resilience\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSyntax Errors\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you make a syntax error during development, you can fix it and save the file\nagain. The error will disappear automatically, so you won't need to reload the\napp. You will not lose component state.\nRuntime Errors\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you make a mistake that leads to a runtime error inside your component,\nyou'll be greeted with a contextual overlay. Fixing the error will automatically\ndismiss the overlay, without reloading the app.\nComponent state will be retained if the error did not occur during rendering. If\nthe error did occur during rendering, React will remount your application using\nthe updated code.\nIf you have error boundaries\nin your app (which is a good idea for graceful failures in production), they\nwill retry rendering on the next edit after a rendering error. This means having\nan error boundary can prevent you from always getting reset to the root app\nstate. However, keep in mind that error boundaries shouldn't be too granular.\nThey are used by React in production, and should always be designed\nintentionally.\nLimitations\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFast Refresh tries to preserve local React state in the component you're\nediting, but only if it's safe to do so. Here's a few reasons why you might see\nlocal state being reset on every edit to a file:\n\nLocal state is not preserved for class components (only function components\nand Hooks preserve state).\nThe file you're editing might have other exports in addition to a React\ncomponent.\nSometimes, a file would export the result of calling a higher-order component\nlike HOC(WrappedComponent). If the returned component is a\nclass, its state will be reset.\nAnonymous arrow functions like export default () => <div />; cause Fast Refresh to not preserve local component state. For large codebases you can use our name-default-component codemod.\n\nAs more of your codebase moves to function components and Hooks, you can expect\nstate to be preserved in more cases.\nTips\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nFast Refresh preserves React local state in function components (and Hooks) by\ndefault.\nSometimes you might want to force the state to be reset, and a component to\nbe remounted. For example, this can be handy if you're tweaking an animation\nthat only happens on mount. To do this, you can add // @refresh reset\nanywhere in the file you're editing. This directive is local to the file, and\ninstructs Fast Refresh to remount components defined in that file on every\nedit.\nYou can put console.log or debugger; into the components you edit during\ndevelopment.\nRemember that imports are case sensitive. Both fast and full refresh can fail,\nwhen your import doesn't match the actual filename.\nFor example, './header' vs './Header'.\n\nFast Refresh and Hooks\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen possible, Fast Refresh attempts to preserve the state of your component\nbetween edits. In particular, useState and useRef preserve their previous\nvalues as long as you don't change their arguments or the order of the Hook\ncalls.\nHooks with dependencies—such as useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback—will\nalways update during Fast Refresh. Their list of dependencies will be ignored\nwhile Fast Refresh is happening.\nFor example, when you edit useMemo(() => x * 2, [x]) to\nuseMemo(() => x * 10, [x]), it will re-run even though x (the dependency)\nhas not changed. If React didn't do that, your edit wouldn't reflect on the\nscreen!\nSometimes, this can lead to unexpected results. For example, even a useEffect\nwith an empty array of dependencies would still re-run once during Fast Refresh.\nHowever, writing code resilient to occasional re-running of useEffect is a good practice even\nwithout Fast Refresh. It will make it easier for you to introduce new dependencies to it later on\nand it's enforced by React Strict Mode,\nwhich we highly recommend enabling."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_architecture_nextjs-compiler.txt","text":"Next.js CompilerThe Next.js Compiler, written in Rust using SWC, allows Next.js to transform and minify your JavaScript code for production. This replaces Babel for individual files and Terser for minifying output bundles.\nCompilation using the Next.js Compiler is 17x faster than Babel and enabled by default since Next.js version 12. If you have an existing Babel configuration or are using unsupported features, your application will opt-out of the Next.js Compiler and continue using Babel.\nWhy SWC?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSWC is an extensible Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools.\nSWC can be used for compilation, minification, bundling, and more – and is designed to be extended. It's something you can call to perform code transformations (either built-in or custom). Running those transformations happens through higher-level tools like Next.js.\nWe chose to build on SWC for a few reasons:\n\nExtensibility: SWC can be used as a Crate inside Next.js, without having to fork the library or workaround design constraints.\nPerformance: We were able to achieve ~3x faster Fast Refresh and ~5x faster builds in Next.js by switching to SWC, with more room for optimization still in progress.\nWebAssembly: Rust's support for WASM is essential for supporting all possible platforms and taking Next.js development everywhere.\nCommunity: The Rust community and ecosystem are amazing and still growing.\n\nSupported Features\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nStyled Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWe're working to port babel-plugin-styled-components to the Next.js Compiler.\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: npm install next@latest.

You can follow the progress here. ssr and displayName transforms are the main requirement for using styled-components in Next.js.\n\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    // see https://styled-components.com/docs/tooling#babel-plugin for more info on the options.\n    styledComponents: {\n      // Enabled by default in development, disabled in production to reduce file size,\n      // setting this will override the default for all environments.\n      displayName?: boolean,\n      // Enabled by default.\n      ssr?: boolean,\n      // Enabled by default.\n      fileName?: boolean,\n      // Empty by default.\n      topLevelImportPaths?: string[],\n      // Defaults to [\"index\"].\n      meaninglessFileNames?: string[],\n      // Enabled by default.\n      cssProp?: boolean,\n      // Empty by default.\n      namespace?: string,\n      // Not supported yet.\n      minify?: boolean,\n      // Not supported yet.\n      transpileTemplateLiterals?: boolean,\n      // Not supported yet.\n      pure?: boolean,\n    },\n  },\n}\nJest\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe Next.js Compiler transpiles your tests and simplifies configuring Jest together with Next.js including:\n\nAuto mocking of .css, .module.css (and their .scss variants), and image imports\nAutomatically sets up transform using SWC\nLoading .env (and all variants) into process.env\nIgnores node_modules from test resolving and transforms\nIgnoring .next from test resolving\nLoads next.config.js for flags that enable experimental SWC transforms\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: npm install next@latest. Then, update your jest.config.js file:\njest.config.jsconst nextJest = require('next/jest')\n \n// Providing the path to your Next.js app which will enable loading next.config.js and .env files\nconst createJestConfig = nextJest({ dir: './' })\n \n// Any custom config you want to pass to Jest\nconst customJestConfig = {\n  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],\n}\n \n// createJestConfig is exported in this way to ensure that next/jest can load the Next.js configuration, which is async\nmodule.exports = createJestConfig(customJestConfig)\nRelay\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo enable Relay support:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    relay: {\n      // This should match relay.config.js\n      src: './',\n      artifactDirectory: './__generated__',\n      language: 'typescript',\n      eagerEsModules: false,\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: In Next.js, all JavaScript files in pages directory are considered routes. So, for relay-compiler you'll need to specify artifactDirectory configuration settings outside of the pages, otherwise relay-compiler will generate files next to the source file in the __generated__ directory, and this file will be considered a route, which will break production builds.\n\nRemove React Properties\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAllows to remove JSX properties. This is often used for testing. Similar to babel-plugin-react-remove-properties.\nTo remove properties matching the default regex ^data-test:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    reactRemoveProperties: true,\n  },\n}\nTo remove custom properties:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    // The regexes defined here are processed in Rust so the syntax is different from\n    // JavaScript `RegExp`s. See https://docs.rs/regex.\n    reactRemoveProperties: { properties: ['^data-custom$'] },\n  },\n}\nRemove Console\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis transform allows for removing all console.* calls in application code (not node_modules). Similar to babel-plugin-transform-remove-console.\nRemove all console.* calls:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    removeConsole: true,\n  },\n}\nRemove console.* output except console.error:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    removeConsole: {\n      exclude: ['error'],\n    },\n  },\n}\nLegacy Decorators\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js will automatically detect experimentalDecorators in jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json. Legacy decorators are commonly used with older versions of libraries like mobx.\nThis flag is only supported for compatibility with existing applications. We do not recommend using legacy decorators in new applications.\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: npm install next@latest. Then, update your jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json file:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true\n  }\n}\nimportSource\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js will automatically detect jsxImportSource in jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json and apply that. This is commonly used with libraries like Theme UI.\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: npm install next@latest. Then, update your jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json file:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsxImportSource\": \"theme-ui\"\n  }\n}\nEmotion\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWe're working to port @emotion/babel-plugin to the Next.js Compiler.\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: npm install next@latest. Then, update your next.config.js file:\nnext.config.js \nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    emotion: boolean | {\n      // default is true. It will be disabled when build type is production.\n      sourceMap?: boolean,\n      // default is 'dev-only'.\n      autoLabel?: 'never' | 'dev-only' | 'always',\n      // default is '[local]'.\n      // Allowed values: `[local]` `[filename]` and `[dirname]`\n      // This option only works when autoLabel is set to 'dev-only' or 'always'.\n      // It allows you to define the format of the resulting label.\n      // The format is defined via string where variable parts are enclosed in square brackets [].\n      // For example labelFormat: \"my-classname--[local]\", where [local] will be replaced with the name of the variable the result is assigned to.\n      labelFormat?: string,\n      // default is undefined.\n      // This option allows you to tell the compiler what imports it should\n      // look at to determine what it should transform so if you re-export\n      // Emotion's exports, you can still use transforms.\n      importMap?: {\n        [packageName: string]: {\n          [exportName: string]: {\n            canonicalImport?: [string, string],\n            styledBaseImport?: [string, string],\n          }\n        }\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\nMinification\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js' swc compiler is used for minification by default since v13. This is 7x faster than Terser.\nIf Terser is still needed for any reason this can be configured.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  swcMinify: false,\n}\nModule Transpilation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can automatically transpile and bundle dependencies from local packages (like monorepos) or from external dependencies (node_modules). This replaces the next-transpile-modules package.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  transpilePackages: ['@acme/ui', 'lodash-es'],\n}\nModularize Imports\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis option has been superseded by optimizePackageImports in Next.js 13.5. We recommend upgrading to use the new option that does not require manual configuration of import paths.\nExperimental Features\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSWC Trace profiling\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can generate SWC's internal transform traces as chromium's trace event format.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    swcTraceProfiling: true,\n  },\n}\nOnce enabled, swc will generate trace named as swc-trace-profile-${timestamp}.json under .next/. Chromium's trace viewer (chrome://tracing/, https://ui.perfetto.dev/), or compatible flamegraph viewer (https://www.speedscope.app/) can load & visualize generated traces.\nSWC Plugins (Experimental)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can configure swc's transform to use SWC's experimental plugin support written in wasm to customize transformation behavior.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    swcPlugins: [\n      [\n        'plugin',\n        {\n          ...pluginOptions,\n        },\n      ],\n    ],\n  },\n}\nswcPlugins accepts an array of tuples for configuring plugins. A tuple for the plugin contains the path to the plugin and an object for plugin configuration. The path to the plugin can be an npm module package name or an absolute path to the .wasm binary itself.\nUnsupported Features\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen your application has a .babelrc file, Next.js will automatically fall back to using Babel for transforming individual files. This ensures backwards compatibility with existing applications that leverage custom Babel plugins.\nIf you're using a custom Babel setup, please share your configuration. We're working to port as many commonly used Babel transformations as possible, as well as supporting plugins in the future.\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.1.0Module Transpilation and Modularize Imports stable.v13.0.0SWC Minifier enabled by default.v12.3.0SWC Minifier stable.v12.2.0SWC Plugins experimental support added.v12.1.0Added support for Styled Components, Jest, Relay, Remove React Properties, Legacy Decorators, Remove Console, and jsxImportSource.v12.0.0Next.js Compiler introduced."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_architecture_supported-browsers.txt","text":"Supported BrowsersNext.js supports modern browsers with zero configuration.\n\nChrome 64+\nEdge 79+\nFirefox 67+\nOpera 51+\nSafari 12+\n\nBrowserslist\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you would like to target specific browsers or features, Next.js supports Browserslist configuration in your package.json file.

We're excited to have you here.\nThis page provides instructions on how to edit the Next.js documentation. Our goal is to ensure that everyone in the community feels empowered to contribute and improve our docs.\nWhy Contribute?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOpen-source work is never done, and neither is documentation. Contributing to docs is a good way for beginners to get involved in open-source and for experienced developers to clarify more complex topics while sharing their knowledge with the community.\nBy contributing to the Next.js docs, you're helping us build a more robust learning resource for all developers. Whether you've found a typo, a confusing section, or you've realized that a particular topic is missing, your contributions are welcomed and appreciated.\nHow to Contribute\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe docs content can be found on the Next.js repo. To contribute, you can edit the files directly on GitHub or clone the repo and edit the files locally.\nGitHub Workflow\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you're new to GitHub, we recommend reading the GitHub Open Source Guide to learn how to fork a repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request.\n\nGood to know: The underlying docs code lives in a private codebase that is synced to the Next.js public repo. This means that you can't preview the docs locally. However, you'll see your changes on nextjs.org after merging a pull request.\n\nWriting MDX\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe docs are written in MDX, a markdown format that supports JSX syntax. This allows us to embed React components in the docs. See the GitHub Markdown Guide for a quick overview of markdown syntax.\nVSCode\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPreviewing Changes Locally\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVSCode has a built-in markdown previewer that you can use to see your edits locally. To enable the previewer for MDX files, you'll need to add a configuration option to your user settings.\nOpen the command palette (⌘ + ⇧ + P on Mac or Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows) and search from Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON).\nThen, add the following line to your settings.json file:\nsettings.json{\n  \"files.associations\": {\n    \"*.mdx\": \"markdown\"\n  }\n}\nNext, open the command palette again, and search for Markdown: Preview File or Markdown: Open Preview to the Side. This will open a preview window where you can see your formatted changes.\nExtensions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWe also recommend the following extensions for VSCode users:\n\nMDX: Intellisense and syntax highlighting for MDX.\nGrammarly: Grammar and spell checker.\nPrettier: Format MDX files on save.\n\nReview Process\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOnce you've submitted your contribution, the Next.js or Developer Experience teams will review your changes, provide feedback, and merge the pull request when it's ready.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or need further assistance in your PR's comments. Thank you for contributing to the Next.js docs and being a part of our community!\n\nTip: Run pnpm prettier-fix to run Prettier before submitting your PR.\n\nFile Structure\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe docs use file-system routing. Each folder and files inside /docs represent a route segment. These segments are used to generate the URL paths, navigation, and breadcrumbs.\nThe file structure reflects the navigation that you see on the site, and by default, navigation items are sorted alphabetically. However, we can change the order of the items by prepending a two-digit number (00-) to the folder or file name.\nFor example, in the functions API Reference, the pages are sorted alphabetically because it makes it easier for developers to find a specific function:\n03-functions\n├── cookies.mdx\n├── draft-mode.mdx\n├── fetch.mdx\n└── ...\nBut, in the routing section, the files are prefixed with a two-digit number, sorted in the order developers should learn these concepts:\n02-routing\n├── 01-defining-routes.mdx\n├── 02-pages-and-layouts.mdx\n├── 03-linking-and-navigating.mdx\n└── ...\nTo quickly find a page, you can use ⌘ + P (Mac) or Ctrl + P (Windows) to open the search bar on VSCode. Then, type the slug of the page you're looking for. E.g. defining-routes\n\nWhy not use a manifest?\nWe considered using a manifest file (another popular way to generate the docs navigation), but we found that a manifest would quickly get out of sync with the files. File-system routing forces us to think about the structure of the docs and feels more native to Next.js.\n\nMetadata\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nEach page has a metadata block at the top of the file separated by three dashes.\nRequired Fields\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following fields are required:\nFieldDescriptiontitleThe page's <h1> title, used for SEO and OG Images.descriptionThe page's description, used in the <meta name=\"description\"> tag for SEO.\nrequired-fields.mdx---\ntitle: Page Title\ndescription: Page Description\n---\nIt's good practice to limit the page title to 2-3 words (e.g. Optimizing Images) and the description to 1-2 sentences (e.g. Learn how to optimize images in Next.js).\nOptional Fields\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following fields are optional:\nFieldDescriptionnav_titleOverrides the page's title in the navigation. This is useful when the page's title is too long to fit. If not provided, the title field is used.sourcePulls content into a shared page. See Shared Pages.relatedA list of related pages at the bottom of the document. These will automatically be turned into cards. See Related Links.\noptional-fields.mdx---\nnav_title: Nav Item Title\nsource: app/building-your-application/optimizing/images\nrelated:\n  description: See the image component API reference.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/components/image\n---\nApp and Pages Docs\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSince most of the features in the App Router and Pages Router are completely different, their docs for each are kept in separate sections (02-app and 03-pages). However, there are a few features that are shared between them.\nShared Pages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo avoid content duplication and risk the content becoming out of sync, we use the source field to pull content from one page into another. For example, the <Link> component behaves mostly the same in App and Pages. Instead of duplicating the content, we can pull the content from app/.../link.mdx into pages/.../link.mdx:\napp/.../link.mdx---\ntitle: <Link>\ndescription: API reference for the <Link> component.\n---\n \nThis API reference will help you understand how to use the props\nand configuration options available for the Link Component.\npages/.../link.mdx---\ntitle: <Link>\ndescription: API reference for the <Link> component.\nsource: app/api-reference/components/link\n---\n \n{/* DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE. */}\n{/* The content of this page is pulled from the source above. */}\nWe can therefore edit the content in one place and have it reflected in both sections.\nShared Content\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn shared pages, sometimes there might be content that is App Router or Pages Router specific. For example, the <Link> component has a shallow prop that is only available in Pages but not in App.\nTo make sure the content only shows in the correct router, we can wrap content blocks in an <AppOnly> or <PagesOnly> components:\napp/.../link.mdxThis content is shared between App and Pages.\n \n<PagesOnly>\n \nThis content will only be shown on the Pages docs.\n \n</PagesOnly>\n \nThis content is shared between App and Pages.\nYou'll likely use these components for examples and code blocks.\nCode Blocks\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCode blocks should contain a minimum working example that can be copied and pasted. This means that the code should be able to run without any additional configuration.\nFor example, if you're showing how to use the <Link> component, you should include the import statement and the <Link> component itself.\napp/page.tsximport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n}\nAlways run examples locally before committing them. This will ensure that the code is up-to-date and working.\nLanguage and Filename\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCode blocks should have a header that includes the language and the filename. Add a filename prop to render a special Terminal icon that helps orientate users where to input the command. For example:\ncode-example.mdx```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx create-next-app\n```\nMost examples in the docs are written in tsx and jsx, and a few in bash. However, you can use any supported language, here's the full list.\nWhen writing JavaScript code blocks, we use the following language and extension combinations.\nLanguageExtensionJavaScript files with JSX code```jsx.jsJavaScript files without JSX```js.jsTypeScript files with JSX```tsx.tsxTypeScript files without JSX```ts.ts\nTS and JS Switcher\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAdd a language switcher to toggle between TypeScript and JavaScript. Code blocks should be TypeScript first with a JavaScript version to accommodate users.\nCurrently, we write TS and JS examples one after the other, and link them with switcher prop:\ncode-example.mdx```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n \n```\n \n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n \n```\n\nGood to know: We plan to automatically compile TypeScript snippets to JavaScript in the future. In the meantime, you can use transform.tools.\n\nLine Highlighting\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCode lines can be highlighted. This is useful when you want to draw attention to a specific part of the code.

Followed by a minimum working example or its API reference.\nConvention: If the feature has a convention, it should be explained here.\nExamples: Show how the feature can be used with different use cases.\nAPI Tables: API Pages should have an overview table at the of the page with jump-to-section links (when possible).\nNext Steps (Related Links): Add links to related pages to guide the user's learning journey.\n\nFeel free to add these sections as needed.\nPage Types\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDocs pages are also split into two categories: Conceptual and Reference.\n\nConceptual pages are used to explain a concept or feature. They are usually longer and contain more information than reference pages. In the Next.js docs, conceptual pages are found in the Building Your Application section.\nReference pages are used to explain a specific API. They are usually shorter and more focused. In the Next.js docs, reference pages are found in the API Reference section.\n\n\nGood to know: Depending on the page you're contributing to, you may need to follow a different voice and style. For example, conceptual pages are more instructional and use the word you to address the user. Reference pages are more technical, they use more imperative words like \"create, update, accept\" and tend to omit the word you.\n\nVoice\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nHere are some guidelines to maintain a consistent style and voice across the docs:\n\nWrite clear, concise sentences. Avoid tangents.\n\nIf you find yourself using a lot of commas, consider breaking the sentence into multiple sentences or use a list.\nSwap out complex words for simpler ones. For example, use instead of utilize.\n\n\nBe mindful with the word this. It can be ambiguous and confusing, don't be afraid to repeat the subject of the sentence if unclear.\n\nFor example, Next.js uses React instead of Next.js uses this.\n\n\nUse an active voice instead of passive. An active sentence is easier to read.\n\nFor example, Next.js uses React instead of React is used by Next.js. If you find yourself using words like was and by you may be using a passive voice.\n\n\nAvoid using words like easy, quick, simple, just, etc. This is subjective and can be discouraging to users.\nAvoid negative words like don't, can't, won't, etc. This can be discouraging to readers.\n\nFor example, \"You can use the Link component to create links between pages\" instead of \"Don't use the <a> tag to create links between pages\".\n\n\nWrite in second person (you/your). This is more personal and engaging.\nUse gender-neutral language. Use developers, users, or readers, when referring to the audience.\nIf adding code examples, ensure they are properly formatted and working.\n\nWhile these guidelines are not exhaustive, they should help you get started.

You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.\nUnder the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.\nWhether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.\nMain Features\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSome of the main Next.js features include:\nFeatureDescriptionRoutingA file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.RenderingClient-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes.Data FetchingSimplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended fetch API for request memoization, data caching and revalidation.StylingSupport for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JSOptimizationsImage, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience.TypeScriptImproved support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.\nHow to Use These Docs\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOn the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.\nOn the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).\nTo get started, checkout the Installation guide.\nApp Router vs Pages Router\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has two different routers: the App Router and the Pages Router. The App Router is a newer router that allows you to use React's latest features, such as Server Components and Streaming. The Pages Router is the original Next.js router, which allowed you to build server-rendered React applications and continues to be supported for older Next.js applications.\nAt the top of the sidebar, you'll notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the App Router and the Pages Router features. Since there are features that are unique to each directory, it's important to keep track of which tab is selected.\nThe breadcrumbs at the top of the page will also indicate whether you're viewing App Router docs or Pages Router docs.\nPre-Requisite Knowledge\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAlthough our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on Next.js functionality. We'll make sure to provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new concept.\nTo get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and React. If you need to brush up on your React skills, check out our React Foundations Course, which will introduce you to the fundamentals. Then, learn more about Next.js by building a dashboard application.\nAccessibility\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor optimal accessibility when using a screen reader while reading the docs, we recommend using Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver.\nJoin our Community\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you have questions about anything related to Next.js, you're always welcome to ask our community on GitHub Discussions, Discord, Twitter, and Reddit."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_getting-started_installation.txt","text":"InstallationSystem Requirements:\n\nNode.js 18.17 or later.\nmacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.\n\nAutomatic Installation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWe recommend starting a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:\nTerminalnpx create-next-app@latest\nOn installation, you'll see the following prompts:\nTerminalWhat is your project named? my-app\nWould you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes\nWould you like to use ESLint? No / Yes\nWould you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes\nWould you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes\nWould you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes\nWould you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes\nWhat import alias would you like configured? @/*\nAfter the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.\nIf you're new to Next.js, see the project structure docs for an overview of all the possible files and folders in your application.\n\nGood to know:\n\nNext.js now ships with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS configuration by default.\nYou can optionally use a src directory in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.\n\n\nManual Installation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:\nTerminalnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest\nOpen your package.json file and add the following scripts:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\nThese scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:\n\ndev: runs next dev to start Next.js in development mode.\nbuild: runs next build to build the application for production usage.\nstart: runs next start to start a Next.js production server.\nlint: runs next lint to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.\n\nCreating directories\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.\nThe app directory\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor new applications, we recommend using the App Router. This router allows you to use React's latest features and is an evolution of the Pages Router based on community feedback.\nCreate an app/ folder, then add a layout.tsx and page.tsx file. These will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (/).\n\nCreate a root layout inside app/layout.tsx with the required <html> and <body> tags:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nFinally, create a home page app/page.tsx with some initial content:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}\n\n\nGood to know: If you forget to create layout.tsx, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with next dev.\n\nLearn more about using the App Router.\nThe pages directory (optional)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you prefer to use the Pages Router instead of the App Router, you can create a pages/ directory at the root of your project.\nThen, add an index.tsx file inside your pages folder. This will be your home page (/):\npages/index.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}\nNext, add an _app.tsx file inside pages/ to define the global layout. Learn more about the custom App file.\npages/_app.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n \nexport default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n\nFinally, add a _document.tsx file inside pages/ to control the initial response from the server. Learn more about the custom Document file.\npages/_document.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\n \nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html>\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  )\n}\nLearn more about using the Pages Router.\n\nGood to know: Although you can use both routers in the same project, routes in app will be prioritized over pages. We recommend using only one router in your new project to avoid confusion.\n\nThe public folder (optional)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCreate a public folder to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public directory can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).\nRun the Development Server\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nRun npm run dev to start the development server.\nVisit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.\nEdit app/page.tsx (or pages/index.tsx) file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_getting-started_project-structure.txt","text":"Next.js Project StructureThis page provides an overview of the project structure of a Next.js application.

Therefore, if you need to use the same font in multiple places, you should load it in one place and import the related font object where you need it. This is done using a font definitions file.\nFor example, create a fonts.ts file in a styles folder at the root of your app directory.\nThen, specify your font definitions as follows:\nstyles/fonts.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Inter, Lora, Source_Sans_3 } from 'next/font/google'\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n \n// define your variable fonts\nconst inter = Inter()\nconst lora = Lora()\n// define 2 weights of a non-variable font\nconst sourceCodePro400 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '400' })\nconst sourceCodePro700 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '700' })\n// define a custom local font where GreatVibes-Regular.ttf is stored in the styles folder\nconst greatVibes = localFont({ src: './GreatVibes-Regular.ttf' })\n \nexport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro400, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes }\n\nYou can now use these definitions in your code as follows:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes } from '../styles/fonts'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p className={inter.className}>Hello world using Inter font</p>\n      <p style={lora.style}>Hello world using Lora font</p>\n      <p className={sourceCodePro700.className}>\n        Hello world using Source_Sans_3 font with weight 700\n      </p>\n      <p className={greatVibes.className}>My title in Great Vibes font</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nTo make it easier to access the font definitions in your code, you can define a path alias in your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json files as follows:\ntsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/fonts\": [\"./styles/fonts\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\nYou can now import any font definition as follows:\napp/about/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { greatVibes, sourceCodePro400 } from '@/fonts'\n\nVersion Changes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.2.0@next/font renamed to next/font.

Setting the loader as a prop on the Image component overrides the default loader defined in the images section of next.config.js.\nA loader is a function returning a URL string for the image, given the following parameters:\n\nsrc\nwidth\nquality\n\nHere is an example of using a custom loader:\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\n \nconst myLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n \nconst MyImage = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      loader={myLoader}\n      src=\"me.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\nsizes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA string that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. The value of sizes will greatly affect performance for images using layout=\"responsive\" or layout=\"fill\". It will be ignored for images using layout=\"intrinsic\" or layout=\"fixed\".\nThe sizes property serves two important purposes related to image performance:\nFirst, the value of sizes is used by the browser to determine which size of the image to download, from next/legacy/image's automatically-generated source set. When the browser chooses, it does not yet know the size of the image on the page, so it selects an image that is the same size or larger than the viewport. The sizes property allows you to tell the browser that the image will actually be smaller than full screen. If you don't specify a sizes value, a default value of 100vw (full screen width) is used.\nSecond, the sizes value is parsed and used to trim the values in the automatically-created source set. If the sizes property includes sizes such as 50vw, which represent a percentage of the viewport width, then the source set is trimmed to not include any values which are too small to ever be necessary.\nFor example, if you know your styling will cause an image to be full-width on mobile devices, in a 2-column layout on tablets, and a 3-column layout on desktop displays, you should include a sizes property such as the following:\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\nconst Example = () => (\n  <div className=\"grid-element\">\n    <Image\n      src=\"/example.png\"\n      layout=\"fill\"\n      sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw,\n              (max-width: 1200px) 50vw,\n              33vw\"\n    />\n  </div>\n)\nThis example sizes could have a dramatic effect on performance metrics. Without the 33vw sizes, the image selected from the server would be 3 times as wide as it needs to be. Because file size is proportional to the square of the width, without sizes the user would download an image that's 9 times larger than necessary.\nLearn more about srcset and sizes:\n\nweb.dev\nmdn\n\nquality\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe quality of the optimized image, an integer between 1 and 100 where 100 is the best quality. Defaults to 75.\npriority\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen true, the image will be considered high priority and\npreload. Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using priority.\nYou should use the priority property on any image detected as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element. It may be appropriate to have multiple priority images, as different images may be the LCP element for different viewport sizes.\nShould only be used when the image is visible above the fold. Defaults to false.\nplaceholder\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA placeholder to use while the image is loading. Possible values are blur or empty. Defaults to empty.\nWhen blur, the blurDataURL property will be used as the placeholder. If src is an object from a static import and the imported image is .jpg, .png, .webp, or .avif, then blurDataURL will be automatically populated.\nFor dynamic images, you must provide the blurDataURL property. Solutions such as Plaiceholder can help with base64 generation.\nWhen empty, there will be no placeholder while the image is loading, only empty space.\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the blur placeholder\nDemo the shimmer effect with blurDataURL prop\nDemo the color effect with blurDataURL prop\n\nAdvanced Props\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn some cases, you may need more advanced usage. The <Image /> component optionally accepts the following advanced properties.\nstyle\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAllows passing CSS styles to the underlying image element.\nNote that all layout modes apply their own styles to the image element, and these automatic styles take precedence over the style prop.\nAlso keep in mind that the required width and height props can interact with your styling. If you use styling to modify an image's width, you must set the height=\"auto\" style as well, or your image will be distorted.\nobjectFit\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDefines how the image will fit into its parent container when using layout=\"fill\".\nThis value is passed to the object-fit CSS property for the src image.\nobjectPosition\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDefines how the image is positioned within its parent element when using layout=\"fill\".\nThis value is passed to the object-position CSS property applied to the image.\nonLoadingComplete\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the placeholder has been removed.\nThe onLoadingComplete function accepts one parameter, an object with the following properties:\n\nnaturalWidth\nnaturalHeight\n\nloading\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nAttention: This property is only meant for advanced usage. Switching an\nimage to load with eager will normally hurt performance.\nWe recommend using the priority property instead, which\nproperly loads the image eagerly for nearly all use cases.\n\nThe loading behavior of the image. Defaults to lazy.\nWhen lazy, defer loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from\nthe viewport.\nWhen eager, load the image immediately.\nLearn more\nblurDataURL\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA Data URL to\nbe used as a placeholder image before the src image successfully loads. Only takes effect when combined\nwith placeholder=\"blur\".\nMust be a base64-encoded image. It will be enlarged and blurred, so a very small image (10px or\nless) is recommended. Including larger images as placeholders may harm your application performance.\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the default blurDataURL prop\nDemo the shimmer effect with blurDataURL prop\nDemo the color effect with blurDataURL prop\n\nYou can also generate a solid color Data URL to match the image.\nlazyBoundary\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA string (with similar syntax to the margin property) that acts as the bounding box used to detect the intersection of the viewport with the image and trigger lazy loading. Defaults to \"200px\".\nIf the image is nested in a scrollable parent element other than the root document, you will also need to assign the lazyRoot prop.\nLearn more\nlazyRoot\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA React Ref pointing to the scrollable parent element. Defaults to null (the document viewport).\nThe Ref must point to a DOM element or a React component that forwards the Ref to the underlying DOM element.\nExample pointing to a DOM element\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\nimport React from 'react'\n \nconst Example = () => {\n  const lazyRoot = React.useRef(null)\n \n  return (\n    <div ref={lazyRoot} style={{ overflowX: 'scroll', width: '500px' }}>\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/one.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/two.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nExample pointing to a React component\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\nimport React from 'react'\n \nconst Container = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n  return (\n    <div ref={ref} style={{ overflowX: 'scroll', width: '500px' }}>\n      {props.children}\n    </div>\n  )\n})\n \nconst Example = () => {\n  const lazyRoot = React.useRef(null)\n \n  return (\n    <Container ref={lazyRoot}>\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/one.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/two.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n    </Container>\n  )\n}\nLearn more\nunoptimized\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen true, the source image will be served as-is instead of changing quality,\nsize, or format. Defaults to false.\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nconst UnoptimizedImage = (props) => {\n  return <Image {...props} unoptimized />\n}\nSince Next.js 12.3.0, this prop can be assigned to all images by updating next.config.js with the following configuration:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    unoptimized: true,\n  },\n}\nOther Props\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOther properties on the <Image /> component will be passed to the underlying\nimg element with the exception of the following:\n\nsrcSet.

It is always \"async\".\n\nConfiguration Options\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nRemote Patterns\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo protect your application from malicious users, configuration is required in order to use external images. This ensures that only external images from your account can be served from the Next.js Image Optimization API. These external images can be configured with the remotePatterns property in your next.config.js file, as shown below:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'example.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/account123/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: The example above will ensure the src property of next/legacy/image must start with https://example.com/account123/. Any other protocol, hostname, port, or unmatched path will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nBelow is another example of the remotePatterns property in the next.config.js file:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: '**.example.com',\n        port: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: The example above will ensure the src property of next/legacy/image must start with https://img1.example.com or https://me.avatar.example.com or any number of subdomains. Any other protocol, port, or unmatched hostname will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nWildcard patterns can be used for both pathname and hostname and have the following syntax:\n\n* match a single path segment or subdomain\n** match any number of path segments at the end or subdomains at the beginning\n\nThe ** syntax does not work in the middle of the pattern.\n\nGood to know: When omitting protocol, port or pathname, then the wildcard ** is implied. This is not recommended because it may allow malicious actors to optimize urls you did not intend.\n\nDomains\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWarning: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of strict remotePatterns in order to protect your application from malicious users. Only use domains if you own all the content served from the domain.\n\nSimilar to remotePatterns, the domains configuration can be used to provide a list of allowed hostnames for external images.\nHowever, the domains configuration does not support wildcard pattern matching and it cannot restrict protocol, port, or pathname.\nBelow is an example of the domains property in the next.config.js file:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    domains: ['assets.acme.com'],\n  },\n}\nLoader Configuration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using the Next.js built-in Image Optimization API, you can configure the loader and path prefix in your next.config.js file. This allows you to use relative URLs for the Image src and automatically generate the correct absolute URL for your provider.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'imgix',\n    path: 'https://example.com/myaccount/',\n  },\n}\nBuilt-in Loaders\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following Image Optimization cloud providers are included:\n\nDefault: Works automatically with next dev, next start, or a custom server\nVercel: Works automatically when you deploy on Vercel, no configuration necessary. Learn more\nImgix: loader: 'imgix'\nCloudinary: loader: 'cloudinary'\nAkamai: loader: 'akamai'\nCustom: loader: 'custom' use a custom cloud provider by implementing the loader prop on the next/legacy/image component\n\nIf you need a different provider, you can use the loader prop with next/legacy/image.\n\nImages can not be optimized at build time using output: 'export', only on-demand. To use next/legacy/image with output: 'export', you will need to use a different loader than the default. Read more in the discussion.\n\n\nThe next/legacy/image component's default loader uses squoosh because it is quick to install and suitable for a development environment. When using next start in your production environment, it is strongly recommended that you install sharp by running npm i sharp in your project directory. This is not necessary for Vercel deployments, as sharp is installed automatically.\n\nAdvanced\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following configuration is for advanced use cases and is usually not necessary. If you choose to configure the properties below, you will override any changes to the Next.js defaults in future updates.\nDevice Sizes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you know the expected device widths of your users, you can specify a list of device width breakpoints using the deviceSizes property in next.config.js. These widths are used when the next/legacy/image component uses layout=\"responsive\" or layout=\"fill\" to ensure the correct image is served for user's device.\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],\n  },\n}\nImage Sizes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can specify a list of image widths using the images.imageSizes property in your next.config.js file. These widths are concatenated with the array of device sizes to form the full array of sizes used to generate image srcsets.\nThe reason there are two separate lists is that imageSizes is only used for images which provide a sizes prop, which indicates that the image is less than the full width of the screen. Therefore, the sizes in imageSizes should all be smaller than the smallest size in deviceSizes.\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],\n  },\n}\nAcceptable Formats\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default Image Optimization API will automatically detect the browser's supported image formats via the request's Accept header.\nIf the Accept head matches more than one of the configured formats, the first match in the array is used. Therefore, the array order matters. If there is no match (or the source image is animated), the Image Optimization API will fallback to the original image's format.\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/webp'],\n  },\n}\nYou can enable AVIF support with the following configuration.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: AVIF generally takes 20% longer to encode but it compresses 20% smaller compared to WebP. This means that the first time an image is requested, it will typically be slower and then subsequent requests that are cached will be faster.\n\nCaching Behavior\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following describes the caching algorithm for the default loader. For all other loaders, please refer to your cloud provider's documentation.\nImages are optimized dynamically upon request and stored in the <distDir>/cache/images directory. The optimized image file will be served for subsequent requests until the expiration is reached. When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the expired image is served stale immediately. Then the image is optimized again in the background (also called revalidation) and saved to the cache with the new expiration date.\nThe cache status of an image can be determined by reading the value of the x-nextjs-cache (x-vercel-cache when deployed on Vercel) response header. The possible values are the following:\n\nMISS - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\nSTALE - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\nHIT - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by either the minimumCacheTTL configuration or the upstream image Cache-Control header, whichever is larger. Specifically, the max-age value of the Cache-Control header is used. If both s-maxage and max-age are found, then s-maxage is preferred. The max-age is also passed-through to any downstream clients including CDNs and browsers.\n\nYou can configure minimumCacheTTL to increase the cache duration when the upstream image does not include Cache-Control header or the value is very low.\nYou can configure deviceSizes and imageSizes to reduce the total number of possible generated images.\nYou can configure formats to disable multiple formats in favor of a single image format.\n\nMinimum Cache TTL\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can configure the Time to Live (TTL) in seconds for cached optimized images. In many cases, it's better to use a Static Image Import which will automatically hash the file contents and cache the image forever with a Cache-Control header of immutable.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    minimumCacheTTL: 60,\n  },\n}\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) of the optimized image is defined by either the minimumCacheTTL or the upstream image Cache-Control header, whichever is larger.\nIf you need to change the caching behavior per image, you can configure headers to set the Cache-Control header on the upstream image (e.g. /some-asset.jpg, not /_next/image itself).\nThere is no mechanism to invalidate the cache at this time, so its best to keep minimumCacheTTL low. Otherwise you may need to manually change the src prop or delete <distDir>/cache/images.\nDisable Static Imports\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default behavior allows you to import static files such as import icon from './icon.png' and then pass that to the src property.\nIn some cases, you may wish to disable this feature if it conflicts with other plugins that expect the import to behave differently.\nYou can disable static image imports inside your next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\nDangerously Allow SVG\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default loader does not optimize SVG images for a few reasons. First, SVG is a vector format meaning it can be resized losslessly. Second, SVG has many of the same features as HTML/CSS, which can lead to vulnerabilities without proper Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.\nTherefore, we recommended using the unoptimized prop when the src prop is known to be SVG. This happens automatically when src ends with \".svg\".\nHowever, if you need to serve SVG images with the default Image Optimization API, you can set dangerouslyAllowSVG inside your next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,\n    contentDispositionType: 'attachment',\n    contentSecurityPolicy: \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;\",\n  },\n}\nIn addition, it is strongly recommended to also set contentDispositionType to force the browser to download the image, as well as contentSecurityPolicy to prevent scripts embedded in the image from executing.\nAnimated Images\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default loader will automatically bypass Image Optimization for animated images and serve the image as-is.\nAuto-detection for animated files is best-effort and supports GIF, APNG, and WebP. If you want to explicitly bypass Image Optimization for a given animated image, use the unoptimized prop.\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.0.0next/image renamed to next/legacy/image"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_api-reference_components_image.txt","text":"<Image>\nExamples\nImage Component\n\n\nGood to know: If you are using a version of Next.js prior to 13, you'll want to use the next/legacy/image documentation since the component was renamed.\n\nThis API reference will help you understand how to use props and configuration options available for the Image Component.

This section describes the most commonly-used properties of the Image component. Find details about more rarely-used properties in the Advanced Props section.\nloader\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA custom function used to resolve image URLs.\nA loader is a function returning a URL string for the image, given the following parameters:\n\nsrc\nwidth\nquality\n\nHere is an example of using a custom loader:\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nconst imageLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      loader={imageLoader}\n      src=\"me.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\nAlternatively, you can use the loaderFile configuration in next.config.js to configure every instance of next/image in your application, without passing a prop.\nfill\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nfill={true} // {true} | {false}\nA boolean that causes the image to fill the parent element, which is useful when the width and height are unknown.\nThe parent element must assign position: \"relative\", position: \"fixed\", or position: \"absolute\" style.\nBy default, the img element will automatically be assigned the position: \"absolute\" style.\nIf no styles are applied to the image, the image will stretch to fit the container. You may prefer to set object-fit: \"contain\" for an image which is letterboxed to fit the container and preserve aspect ratio.\nAlternatively, object-fit: \"cover\" will cause the image to fill the entire container and be cropped to preserve aspect ratio. For this to look correct, the overflow: \"hidden\" style should be assigned to the parent element.\nFor more information, see also:\n\nposition\nobject-fit\nobject-position\n\nsizes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA string, similar to a media query, that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. The value of sizes will greatly affect performance for images using fill or which are styled to have a responsive size.\nThe sizes property serves two important purposes related to image performance:\n\nFirst, the value of sizes is used by the browser to determine which size of the image to download, from next/image's automatically generated srcset. When the browser chooses, it does not yet know the size of the image on the page, so it selects an image that is the same size or larger than the viewport. The sizes property allows you to tell the browser that the image will actually be smaller than full screen. If you don't specify a sizes value in an image with the fill property, a default value of 100vw (full screen width) is used.\nSecond, the sizes property changes the behavior of the automatically generated srcset value. If no sizes value is present, a small srcset is generated, suitable for a fixed-size image (1x/2x/etc). If sizes is defined, a large srcset is generated, suitable for a responsive image (640w/750w/etc). If the sizes property includes sizes such as 50vw, which represent a percentage of the viewport width, then the srcset is trimmed to not include any values which are too small to ever be necessary.\n\nFor example, if you know your styling will cause an image to be full-width on mobile devices, in a 2-column layout on tablets, and a 3-column layout on desktop displays, you should include a sizes property such as the following:\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"grid-element\">\n      <Image\n        fill\n        src=\"/example.png\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nThis example sizes could have a dramatic effect on performance metrics. Without the 33vw sizes, the image selected from the server would be 3 times as wide as it needs to be. Because file size is proportional to the square of the width, without sizes the user would download an image that's 9 times larger than necessary.\nLearn more about srcset and sizes:\n\nweb.dev\nmdn\n\nquality\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nquality={75} // {number 1-100}\nThe quality of the optimized image, an integer between 1 and 100, where 100 is the best quality and therefore largest file size. Defaults to 75.\npriority\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\npriority={false} // {false} | {true}\nWhen true, the image will be considered high priority and\npreload. Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using priority.\nYou should use the priority property on any image detected as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element. It may be appropriate to have multiple priority images, as different images may be the LCP element for different viewport sizes.\nShould only be used when the image is visible above the fold. Defaults to false.\nplaceholder\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nplaceholder = 'empty' // \"empty\" | \"blur\" | \"data:image/...\"\nA placeholder to use while the image is loading. Possible values are blur, empty, or data:image/.... Defaults to empty.\nWhen blur, the blurDataURL property will be used as the placeholder. If src is an object from a static import and the imported image is .jpg, .png, .webp, or .avif, then blurDataURL will be automatically populated, except when the image is detected to be animated.\nFor dynamic images, you must provide the blurDataURL property. Solutions such as Plaiceholder can help with base64 generation.\nWhen data:image/..., the Data URL will be used as the placeholder while the image is loading.\nWhen empty, there will be no placeholder while the image is loading, only empty space.\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the blur placeholder\nDemo the shimmer effect with data URL placeholder prop\nDemo the color effect with blurDataURL prop\n\nAdvanced Props\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn some cases, you may need more advanced usage. The <Image /> component optionally accepts the following advanced properties.\nstyle\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAllows passing CSS styles to the underlying image element.\ncomponents/ProfileImage.jsconst imageStyle = {\n  borderRadius: '50%',\n  border: '1px solid #fff',\n}\n \nexport default function ProfileImage() {\n  return <Image src=\"...\" style={imageStyle} />\n}\nRemember that the required width and height props can interact with your styling. If you use styling to modify an image's width, you should also style its height to auto to preserve its intrinsic aspect ratio, or your image will be distorted.\nonLoadingComplete\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n<Image onLoadingComplete={(img) => console.log(img.naturalWidth)} />\n\nWarning: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of onLoad.\n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the placeholder has been removed.\nThe callback function will be called with one argument, a reference to the underlying <img> element.\n\nonLoad\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n<Image onLoad={(e) => console.log(e.target.naturalWidth)} />\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the placeholder has been removed.\nThe callback function will be called with one argument, the Event which has a target that references the underlying <img> element.\n\nonError\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n<Image onError={(e) => console.error(e.target.id)} />\nA callback function that is invoked if the image fails to load.\n\nloading\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nRecommendation: This property is only meant for advanced use cases. Switching an image to load with eager will normally hurt performance. We recommend using the priority property instead, which will eagerly preload the image.\n\nloading = 'lazy' // {lazy} | {eager}\nThe loading behavior of the image. Defaults to lazy.\nWhen lazy, defer loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from\nthe viewport.\nWhen eager, load the image immediately.\nLearn more about the loading attribute.\nblurDataURL\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA Data URL to\nbe used as a placeholder image before the src image successfully loads. Only takes effect when combined\nwith placeholder=\"blur\".\nMust be a base64-encoded image. It will be enlarged and blurred, so a very small image (10px or\nless) is recommended. Including larger images as placeholders may harm your application performance.\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the default blurDataURL prop\nDemo the color effect with blurDataURL prop\n\nYou can also generate a solid color Data URL to match the image.\nunoptimized\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nunoptimized = {false} // {false} | {true}\nWhen true, the source image will be served as-is instead of changing quality,\nsize, or format. Defaults to false.\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nconst UnoptimizedImage = (props) => {\n  return <Image {...props} unoptimized />\n}\nSince Next.js 12.3.0, this prop can be assigned to all images by updating next.config.js with the following configuration:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    unoptimized: true,\n  },\n}\noverrideSrc\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen providing the src prop to the <Image> component, both the srcset and src attributes are generated automatically for the resulting <img>.\ninput.js<Image src=\"/me.jpg\" />\noutput.html<img\n  srcset=\"\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=640&q=75 1x,\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75 2x\n  \"\n  src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75\"\n/>\nIn some cases, it is not desirable to have the src attribute generated and you may wish to override it using the overrideSrc prop.\nFor example, when upgrading an existing website from <img> to <Image>, you may wish to maintain the same src attribute for SEO purposes such as image ranking or avoiding recrawl.\ninput.js<Image src=\"/me.jpg\" overrideSrc=\"/override.jpg\" />\noutput.html<img\n  srcset=\"\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=640&q=75 1x,\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75 2x\n  \"\n  src=\"/override.jpg\"\n/>\nOther Props\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOther properties on the <Image /> component will be passed to the underlying\nimg element with the exception of the following:\n\nsrcSet. Use Device Sizes instead.\ndecoding. It is always \"async\".\n\nConfiguration Options\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn addition to props, you can configure the Image Component in next.config.js. The following options are available:\nremotePatterns\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo protect your application from malicious users, configuration is required in order to use external images. This ensures that only external images from your account can be served from the Next.js Image Optimization API. These external images can be configured with the remotePatterns property in your next.config.js file, as shown below:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'example.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/account123/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: The example above will ensure the src property of next/image must start with https://example.com/account123/. Any other protocol, hostname, port, or unmatched path will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nBelow is another example of the remotePatterns property in the next.config.js file:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: '**.example.com',\n        port: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: The example above will ensure the src property of next/image must start with https://img1.example.com or https://me.avatar.example.com or any number of subdomains. Any other protocol, port, or unmatched hostname will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nWildcard patterns can be used for both pathname and hostname and have the following syntax:\n\n* match a single path segment or subdomain\n** match any number of path segments at the end or subdomains at the beginning\n\nThe ** syntax does not work in the middle of the pattern.\n\nGood to know: When omitting protocol, port or pathname, then the wildcard ** is implied. This is not recommended because it may allow malicious actors to optimize urls you did not intend.\n\ndomains\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWarning: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of strict remotePatterns in order to protect your application from malicious users. Only use domains if you own all the content served from the domain.\n\nSimilar to remotePatterns, the domains configuration can be used to provide a list of allowed hostnames for external images.\nHowever, the domains configuration does not support wildcard pattern matching and it cannot restrict protocol, port, or pathname.\nBelow is an example of the domains property in the next.config.js file:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    domains: ['assets.acme.com'],\n  },\n}\nloaderFile\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using the Next.js built-in Image Optimization API, you can configure the loaderFile in your next.config.js like the following:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'custom',\n    loaderFile: './my/image/loader.js',\n  },\n}\nThis must point to a file relative to the root of your Next.js application. The file must export a default function that returns a string, for example:\n\nmy/image/loader.jsexport default function myImageLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\nAlternatively, you can use the loader prop to configure each instance of next/image.\nExamples:\n\nCustom Image Loader Configuration\n\n\nAdvanced\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following configuration is for advanced use cases and is usually not necessary. If you choose to configure the properties below, you will override any changes to the Next.js defaults in future updates.\ndeviceSizes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you know the expected device widths of your users, you can specify a list of device width breakpoints using the deviceSizes property in next.config.js. These widths are used when the next/image component uses sizes prop to ensure the correct image is served for user's device.\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],\n  },\n}\nimageSizes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can specify a list of image widths using the images.imageSizes property in your next.config.js file. These widths are concatenated with the array of device sizes to form the full array of sizes used to generate image srcsets.\nThe reason there are two separate lists is that imageSizes is only used for images which provide a sizes prop, which indicates that the image is less than the full width of the screen. Therefore, the sizes in imageSizes should all be smaller than the smallest size in deviceSizes.\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],\n  },\n}\nformats\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default Image Optimization API will automatically detect the browser's supported image formats via the request's Accept header.\nIf the Accept head matches more than one of the configured formats, the first match in the array is used. Therefore, the array order matters. If there is no match (or the source image is animated), the Image Optimization API will fallback to the original image's format.\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/webp'],\n  },\n}\nYou can enable AVIF support with the following configuration.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nAVIF generally takes 20% longer to encode but it compresses 20% smaller compared to WebP. This means that the first time an image is requested, it will typically be slower and then subsequent requests that are cached will be faster.\nIf you self-host with a Proxy/CDN in front of Next.js, you must configure the Proxy to forward the Accept header.\n\n\nCaching Behavior\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following describes the caching algorithm for the default loader. For all other loaders, please refer to your cloud provider's documentation.\nImages are optimized dynamically upon request and stored in the <distDir>/cache/images directory. The optimized image file will be served for subsequent requests until the expiration is reached. When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the expired image is served stale immediately. Then the image is optimized again in the background (also called revalidation) and saved to the cache with the new expiration date.\nThe cache status of an image can be determined by reading the value of the x-nextjs-cache response header. The possible values are the following:\n\nMISS - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\nSTALE - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\nHIT - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by either the minimumCacheTTL configuration or the upstream image Cache-Control header, whichever is larger. Specifically, the max-age value of the Cache-Control header is used. If both s-maxage and max-age are found, then s-maxage is preferred. The max-age is also passed-through to any downstream clients including CDNs and browsers.\n\nYou can configure minimumCacheTTL to increase the cache duration when the upstream image does not include Cache-Control header or the value is very low.\nYou can configure deviceSizes and imageSizes to reduce the total number of possible generated images.\nYou can configure formats to disable multiple formats in favor of a single image format.\n\nminimumCacheTTL\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can configure the Time to Live (TTL) in seconds for cached optimized images. In many cases, it's better to use a Static Image Import which will automatically hash the file contents and cache the image forever with a Cache-Control header of immutable.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    minimumCacheTTL: 60,\n  },\n}\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) of the optimized image is defined by either the minimumCacheTTL or the upstream image Cache-Control header, whichever is larger.\nIf you need to change the caching behavior per image, you can configure headers to set the Cache-Control header on the upstream image (e.g. /some-asset.jpg, not /_next/image itself).\nThere is no mechanism to invalidate the cache at this time, so its best to keep minimumCacheTTL low. Otherwise you may need to manually change the src prop or delete <distDir>/cache/images.\ndisableStaticImages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default behavior allows you to import static files such as import icon from './icon.png' and then pass that to the src property.\nIn some cases, you may wish to disable this feature if it conflicts with other plugins that expect the import to behave differently.\nYou can disable static image imports inside your next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\ndangerouslyAllowSVG\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default loader does not optimize SVG images for a few reasons. First, SVG is a vector format meaning it can be resized losslessly. Second, SVG has many of the same features as HTML/CSS, which can lead to vulnerabilities without proper Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.\nTherefore, we recommended using the unoptimized prop when the src prop is known to be SVG. This happens automatically when src ends with \".svg\".\nHowever, if you need to serve SVG images with the default Image Optimization API, you can set dangerouslyAllowSVG inside your next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,\n    contentDispositionType: 'attachment',\n    contentSecurityPolicy: \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;\",\n  },\n}\nIn addition, it is strongly recommended to also set contentDispositionType to force the browser to download the image, as well as contentSecurityPolicy to prevent scripts embedded in the image from executing.\nAnimated Images\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default loader will automatically bypass Image Optimization for animated images and serve the image as-is.\nAuto-detection for animated files is best-effort and supports GIF, APNG, and WebP. If you want to explicitly bypass Image Optimization for a given animated image, use the unoptimized prop.\nResponsive Images\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default generated srcset contains 1x and 2x images in order to support different device pixel ratios. However, you may wish to render a responsive image that stretches with the viewport. In that case, you'll need to set sizes as well as style (or className).\nYou can render a responsive image using one of the following methods below.\nResponsive image using a static import\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf the source image is not dynamic, you can statically import to create a responsive image:\ncomponents/author.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport me from '../photos/me.jpg'\n \nexport default function Author() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={me}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        width: '100%',\n        height: 'auto',\n      }}\n    />\n  )\n}\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the image responsive to viewport\n\nResponsive image with aspect ratio\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf the source image is a dynamic or a remote url, you will also need to provide width and height to set the correct aspect ratio of the responsive image:\ncomponents/page.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page({ photoUrl }) {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={photoUrl}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        width: '100%',\n        height: 'auto',\n      }}\n      width={500}\n      height={300}\n    />\n  )\n}\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the image responsive to viewport\n\nResponsive image with fill\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you don't know the aspect ratio, you will need to set the fill prop and set position: relative on the parent. Optionally, you can set object-fit style depending on the desired stretch vs crop behavior:\napp/page.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page({ photoUrl }) {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '300px', height: '500px' }}>\n      <Image\n        src={photoUrl}\n        alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n        sizes=\"300px\"\n        fill\n        style={{\n          objectFit: 'contain',\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the fill prop\n\nTheme Detection CSS\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to display a different image for light and dark mode, you can create a new component that wraps two <Image> components and reveals the correct one based on a CSS media query.\ncomponents/theme-image.module.css.imgDark {\n  display: none;\n}\n \n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  .imgLight {\n    display: none;\n  }\n  .imgDark {\n    display: unset;\n  }\n}\ncomponents/theme-image.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport styles from './theme-image.module.css'\nimport Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \ntype Props = Omit<ImageProps, 'src' | 'priority' | 'loading'> & {\n  srcLight: string\n  srcDark: string\n}\n \nconst ThemeImage = (props: Props) => {\n  const { srcLight, srcDark, ...rest } = props\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcLight} className={styles.imgLight} />\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcDark} className={styles.imgDark} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know: The default behavior of loading=\"lazy\" ensures that only the correct image is loaded. You cannot use priority or loading=\"eager\" because that would cause both images to load. Instead, you can use fetchPriority=\"high\".\n\nTry it out:\n\nDemo light/dark mode theme detection\n\ngetImageProps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor more advanced use cases, you can call getImageProps() to get the props that would be passed to the underlying <img> element, and instead pass to them to another component, style, canvas, etc.\nThis also avoid calling React useState() so it can lead to better performance, but it cannot be used with the placeholder prop because the placeholder will never be removed.\nTheme Detection Picture\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to display a different image for light and dark mode, you can use the <picture> element to display a different image based on the user's preferred color scheme.\napp/page.jsimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const common = { alt: 'Theme Example', width: 800, height: 400 }\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: dark },\n  } = getImageProps({ ...common, src: '/dark.png' })\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: light, ...rest },\n  } = getImageProps({ ...common, src: '/light.png' })\n \n  return (\n    <picture>\n      <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcSet={dark} />\n      <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcSet={light} />\n      <img {...rest} />\n    </picture>\n  )\n}\nArt Direction\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to display a different image for mobile and desktop, sometimes called Art Direction, you can provide different src, width, height, and quality props to getImageProps().\napp/page.jsimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  const common = { alt: 'Art Direction Example', sizes: '100vw' }\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: desktop },\n  } = getImageProps({\n    ...common,\n    width: 1440,\n    height: 875,\n    quality: 80,\n    src: '/desktop.jpg',\n  })\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: mobile, ...rest },\n  } = getImageProps({\n    ...common,\n    width: 750,\n    height: 1334,\n    quality: 70,\n    src: '/mobile.jpg',\n  })\n \n  return (\n    <picture>\n      <source media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\" srcSet={desktop} />\n      <source media=\"(min-width: 500px)\" srcSet={mobile} />\n      <img {...rest} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />\n    </picture>\n  )\n}\nBackground CSS\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can even convert the srcSet string to the image-set() CSS function to optimize a background image.\napp/page.jsimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nfunction getBackgroundImage(srcSet = '') {\n  const imageSet = srcSet\n    .split(', ')\n    .map((str) => {\n      const [url, dpi] = str.split(' ')\n      return `url(\"${url}\") ${dpi}`\n    })\n    .join(', ')\n  return `image-set(${imageSet})`\n}\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet },\n  } = getImageProps({ alt: '', width: 128, height: 128, src: '/img.png' })\n  const backgroundImage = getBackgroundImage(srcSet)\n  const style = { height: '100vh', width: '100vw', backgroundImage }\n \n  return (\n    <main style={style}>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\nKnown Browser Bugs\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis next/image component uses browser native lazy loading, which may fallback to eager loading for older browsers before Safari 15.4. When using the blur-up placeholder, older browsers before Safari 12 will fallback to empty placeholder. When using styles with width/height of auto, it is possible to cause Layout Shift on older browsers before Safari 15 that don't preserve the aspect ratio. For more details, see this MDN video.\n\nSafari 15 - 16.3 display a gray border while loading. Safari 16.4 fixed this issue. Possible solutions:\n\nUse CSS @supports (font: -apple-system-body) and (-webkit-appearance: none) { img[loading=\"lazy\"] { clip-path: inset(0.6px) } }\nUse priority if the image is above the fold\n\n\nFirefox 67+ displays a white background while loading.

It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.\n\nFor an example, consider a pages directory with the following files:\npages/index.js\npages/about.js\npages/blog/[slug].js\nWe can have a link to each of these pages like so:import Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/about\">About Us</Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/blog/hello-world\">Blog Post</Link>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Home\nProps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nHere's a summary of the props available for the Link Component:\nPropExampleTypeRequiredhrefhref=\"/dashboard\"String or ObjectYesreplacereplace={false}Boolean-scrollscroll={false}Boolean-prefetchprefetch={false}Boolean-\n\n\nGood to know: <a> tag attributes such as className or target=\"_blank\" can be added to <Link> as props and will be passed to the underlying <a> element.\n\nhref (required)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe path or URL to navigate to.\n<Link href=\"/dashboard\">Dashboard</Link>\nhref can also accept an object, for example:\n// Navigate to /about?name=test\n<Link\n  href={{\n    pathname: '/about',\n    query: { name: 'test' },\n  }}\n>\n  About\n</Link>\nreplace\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDefaults to false. When true, next/link will replace the current history state instead of adding a new URL into the browser’s history stack.\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" replace>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n\nscroll\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDefaults to true. The default behavior of <Link> is to scroll to the top of a new route or to maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation. When false, next/link will not scroll to the top of the page after a navigation.\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" scroll={false}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nNext.js will scroll to the Page if it is not visible in the viewport upon navigation.\n\n\nprefetch\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nPrefetching happens when a <Link /> component enters the user's viewport (initially or through scroll).

Prefetching is only enabled in production.\ntrue (default): The full route and its data will be prefetched.\nfalse: Prefetching will not happen when entering the viewport, but will happen on hover. If you want to completely remove fetching on hover as well, consider using an <a> tag or incrementally adopting the App Router, which enables disabling prefetching on hover too.\npages/index.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" prefetch={false}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}Other Props\n  \n    \n    \n  \nlegacyBehavior\n  \n    \n    \n  \nAn <a> element is no longer required as a child of <Link>. Add the legacyBehavior prop to use the legacy behavior or remove the <a> to upgrade.

When false href has to include the locale as the default behavior is disabled.\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nLinking to Dynamic Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor dynamic routes, it can be handy to use template literals to create the link's path.\nFor example, you can generate a list of links to the dynamic route pages/blog/[slug].jspages/blog/index.jsimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Posts({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Posts\n\nIf the child is a custom component that wraps an <a> tag\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nIf the child of Link is a custom component that wraps an <a> tag, you must add passHref to Link. This is necessary if you’re using libraries like styled-components. Without this, the <a> tag will not have the href attribute, which hurts your site's accessibility and might affect SEO. If you're using ESLint, there is a built-in rule next/link-passhref to ensure correct usage of passHref.\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\n \n// This creates a custom component that wraps an <a> tag\nconst RedLink = styled.a`\n  color: red;\n`\n \nfunction NavLink({ href, name }) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={href} passHref legacyBehavior>\n      <RedLink>{name}</RedLink>\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default NavLink\n\nIf you’re using emotion’s JSX pragma feature (@jsx jsx), you must use passHref even if you use an <a> tag directly.\nThe component should support onClick property to trigger navigation correctly\n\nIf the child is a functional component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf the child of Link is a functional component, in addition to using passHref and legacyBehavior, you must wrap the component in React.forwardRef:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \n// `onClick`, `href`, and `ref` need to be passed to the DOM element\n// for proper handling\nconst MyButton = React.forwardRef(({ onClick, href }, ref) => {\n  return (\n    <a href={href} onClick={onClick} ref={ref}>\n      Click Me\n    </a>\n  )\n})\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/about\" passHref legacyBehavior>\n      <MyButton />\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Home\nWith URL Object\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nLink can also receive a URL object and it will automatically format it to create the URL string. Here's how to do it:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <Link\n          href={{\n            pathname: '/about',\n            query: { name: 'test' },\n          }}\n        >\n          About us\n        </Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link\n          href={{\n            pathname: '/blog/[slug]',\n            query: { slug: 'my-post' },\n          }}\n        >\n          Blog Post\n        </Link>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Home\nThe above example has a link to:\n\nA predefined route: /about?name=test\nA dynamic route: /blog/my-post\n\nYou can use every property as defined in the Node.js URL module documentation.\nReplace the URL instead of push\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default behavior of the Link component is to push a new URL into the history stack. You can use the replace prop to prevent adding a new entry, as in the following example:\n<Link href=\"/about\" replace>\n  About us\n</Link>\nDisable scrolling to the top of the page\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe default behavior of Link is to scroll to the top of the page. When there is a hash defined it will scroll to the specific id, like a normal <a> tag. To prevent scrolling to the top / hash scroll={false} can be added to Link:\n<Link href=\"/#hashid\" scroll={false}>\n  Disables scrolling to the top\n</Link>\nMiddleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIt's common to use Middleware for authentication or other purposes that involve rewriting the user to a different page. In order for the <Link /> component to properly prefetch links with rewrites via Middleware, you need to tell Next.js both the URL to display and the URL to prefetch. This is required to avoid un-necessary fetches to middleware to know the correct route to prefetch.\nFor example, if you want to serve a /dashboard route that has authenticated and visitor views, you may add something similar to the following in your Middleware to redirect the user to the correct page:\nmiddleware.jsexport function middleware(req) {\n  const nextUrl = req.nextUrl\n  if (nextUrl.pathname === '/dashboard') {\n    if (req.cookies.authToken) {\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/auth/dashboard', req.url))\n    } else {\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/public/dashboard', req.url))\n    }\n  }\n}\nIn this case, you would want to use the following code in your <Link /> component:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport useIsAuthed from './hooks/useIsAuthed'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const isAuthed = useIsAuthed()\n  const path = isAuthed ? '/auth/dashboard' : '/public/dashboard'\n  return (\n    <Link as=\"/dashboard\" href={path}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know: If you're using Dynamic Routes, you'll need to adapt your as and href props. For example, if you have a Dynamic Route like /dashboard/authed/[user] that you want to present differently via middleware, you would write: <Link href={{ pathname: '/dashboard/authed/[user]', query: { user: username } }} as=\"/dashboard/[user]\">Profile</Link>.\n\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.0.0No longer requires a child <a> tag.

For example, suppose that you have a page that uses Dynamic Routes named pages/posts/[id].js. If you export getStaticPaths from this page and return the following for paths:\nreturn {\n  paths: [\n    { params: { id: '1' }},\n    {\n      params: { id: '2' },\n      // with i18n configured the locale for the path can be returned as well\n      locale: \"en\",\n    },\n  ],\n  fallback: ...\n}\nThen, Next.js will statically generate /posts/1 and /posts/2 during next build using the page component in pages/posts/[id].js.\nThe value for each params object must match the parameters used in the page name:\n\nIf the page name is pages/posts/[postId]/[commentId], then params should contain postId and commentId.\nIf the page name uses catch-all routes like pages/[...slug], then params should contain slug (which is an array). If this array is ['hello', 'world'], then Next.js will statically generate the page at /hello/world.\nIf the page uses an optional catch-all route, use null, [], undefined or false to render the root-most route. For example, if you supply slug: false for pages/[[...slug]], Next.js will statically generate the page /.\n\nThe params strings are case-sensitive and ideally should be normalized to ensure the paths are generated correctly. For example, if WoRLD is returned for a param it will only match if WoRLD is the actual path visited, not world or World.\nSeparate of the params object a locale field can be returned when i18n is configured, which configures the locale for the path being generated.\nfallback: false\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf fallback is false, then any paths not returned by getStaticPaths will result in a 404 page.\nWhen next build is run, Next.js will check if getStaticPaths returned fallback: false, it will then build only the paths returned by getStaticPaths. This option is useful if you have a small number of paths to create, or new page data is not added often. If you find that you need to add more paths, and you have fallback: false, you will need to run next build again so that the new paths can be generated.\nThe following example pre-renders one blog post per page called pages/posts/[id].js. The list of blog posts will be fetched from a CMS and returned by getStaticPaths. Then, for each page, it fetches the post data from a CMS using getStaticProps.\npages/posts/[id].jsfunction Post({ post }) {\n  // Render post...\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n \n  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.\n  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.\n  return { paths, fallback: false }\n}\n \n// This also gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  // params contains the post `id`.\n  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  // Pass post data to the page via props\n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n \nexport default Post\nfallback: true\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nExamples\nStatic generation of a large number of pages\n\nIf fallback is true, then the behavior of getStaticProps changes in the following ways:\n\nThe paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to HTML at build time by getStaticProps.\nThe paths that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page. Instead, Next.js will serve a “fallback” version of the page on the first request to such a path. Web crawlers, such as Google, won't be served a fallback and instead the path will behave as in fallback: 'blocking'.\nWhen a page with fallback: true is navigated to through next/link or next/router (client-side) Next.js will not serve a fallback and instead the page will behave as fallback: 'blocking'.\nIn the background, Next.js will statically generate the requested path HTML and JSON. This includes running getStaticProps.\nWhen complete, the browser receives the JSON for the generated path. This will be used to automatically render the page with the required props. From the user’s perspective, the page will be swapped from the fallback page to the full page.\nAt the same time, Next.js adds this path to the list of pre-rendered pages. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, like other pages pre-rendered at build time.\n\n\nGood to know: fallback: true is not supported when using output: 'export'.\n\nWhen is fallback: true useful?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nfallback: true is useful if your app has a very large number of static pages that depend on data (such as a very large e-commerce site). If you want to pre-render all product pages, the builds would take a very long time.\nInstead, you may statically generate a small subset of pages and use fallback: true for the rest. When someone requests a page that is not generated yet, the user will see the page with a loading indicator or skeleton component.\nShortly after, getStaticProps finishes and the page will be rendered with the requested data. From now on, everyone who requests the same page will get the statically pre-rendered page.\nThis ensures that users always have a fast experience while preserving fast builds and the benefits of Static Generation.\nfallback: true will not update generated pages, for that take a look at Incremental Static Regeneration.\nfallback: 'blocking'\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf fallback is 'blocking', new paths not returned by getStaticPaths will wait for the HTML to be generated, identical to SSR (hence why blocking), and then be cached for future requests so it only happens once per path.\ngetStaticProps will behave as follows:\n\nThe paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to HTML at build time by getStaticProps.\nThe paths that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page. Instead, Next.js will SSR on the first request and return the generated HTML.\nWhen complete, the browser receives the HTML for the generated path. From the user’s perspective, it will transition from \"the browser is requesting the page\" to \"the full page is loaded\". There is no flash of loading/fallback state.\nAt the same time, Next.js adds this path to the list of pre-rendered pages. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, like other pages pre-rendered at build time.\n\nfallback: 'blocking' will not update generated pages by default. To update generated pages, use Incremental Static Regeneration in conjunction with fallback: 'blocking'.\n\nGood to know: fallback: 'blocking' is not supported when using output: 'export'.\n\nFallback pages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the “fallback” version of a page:\n\nThe page’s props will be empty.\nUsing the router, you can detect if the fallback is being rendered, router.isFallback will be true.\n\nThe following example showcases using isFallback:\npages/posts/[id].jsimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nfunction Post({ post }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  // If the page is not yet generated, this will be displayed\n  // initially until getStaticProps() finishes running\n  if (router.isFallback) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n \n  // Render post...\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    // Only `/posts/1` and `/posts/2` are generated at build time\n    paths: [{ params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }],\n    // Enable statically generating additional pages\n    // For example: `/posts/3`\n    fallback: true,\n  }\n}\n \n// This also gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  // params contains the post `id`.\n  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  // Pass post data to the page via props\n  return {\n    props: { post },\n    // Re-generate the post at most once per second\n    // if a request comes in\n    revalidate: 1,\n  }\n}\n \nexport default Post\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.4.0App Router is now stable with simplified data fetching, including generateStaticParams()v12.2.0On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration is stable.v12.1.0On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration added (beta).v9.5.0Stable Incremental Static Regenerationv9.3.0getStaticPaths introduced."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_api-reference_functions_get-static-props.txt","text":"getStaticPropsExporting a function called getStaticProps will pre-render a page at build time using the props returned from the function:\npages/index.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { InferGetStaticPropsType, GetStaticProps } from 'next'\n \ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n \nexport const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetStaticProps<{\n  repo: Repo\n}>\n \nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {\n  return repo.stargazers_count\n}\n\nYou can import modules in top-level scope for use in getStaticProps.

For example, if the page name is [id].js, then params will look like { id: ... }. You should use this together with getStaticPaths, which we'll explain later.preview(Deprecated for draftMode) preview is true if the page is in the Preview Mode and false otherwise.previewData(Deprecated for draftMode) The preview data set by setPreviewData.draftModedraftMode is true if the page is in the Draft Mode and false otherwise.localeContains the active locale (if enabled).localesContains all supported locales (if enabled).defaultLocaleContains the configured default locale (if enabled).revalidateReasonProvides a reason for why the function was called. Can be one of: \"build\" (run at build time), \"stale\" (revalidate period expired, or running in development mode), \"on-demand\" (triggered via on-demand revalidation)\ngetStaticProps return values\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe getStaticProps function should return an object containing either props, redirect, or notFound followed by an optional revalidate property.\nprops\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe props object is a key-value pair, where each value is received by the page component. It should be a serializable object so that any props passed, could be serialized with JSON.stringify.\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  return {\n    props: { message: `Next.js is awesome` }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\nrevalidate\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe revalidate property is the amount in seconds after which a page re-generation can occur (defaults to false or no revalidation).\n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if\n// revalidation is enabled and a new request comes in\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:\n    // - When a request comes in\n    // - At most once every 10 seconds\n    revalidate: 10, // In seconds\n  }\n}\nLearn more about Incremental Static Regeneration.\nThe cache status of a page leveraging ISR can be determined by reading the value of the x-nextjs-cache response header. The possible values are the following:\n\nMISS - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\nSTALE - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\nHIT - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\nnotFound\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe notFound boolean allows the page to return a 404 status and 404 Page. With notFound: true, the page will return a 404 even if there was a successfully generated page before. This is meant to support use cases like user-generated content getting removed by its author. Note, notFound follows the same revalidate behavior described here.\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  if (!data) {\n    return {\n      notFound: true,\n    }\n  }\n \n  return {\n    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n\nGood to know: notFound is not needed for fallback: false mode as only paths returned from getStaticPaths will be pre-rendered.\n\nredirect\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe redirect object allows redirecting to internal or external resources. It should match the shape of { destination: string, permanent: boolean }.\nIn some rare cases, you might need to assign a custom status code for older HTTP clients to properly redirect. In these cases, you can use the statusCode property instead of the permanent property, but not both. You can also set basePath: false similar to redirects in next.config.js.\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  if (!data) {\n    return {\n      redirect: {\n        destination: '/',\n        permanent: false,\n        // statusCode: 301\n      },\n    }\n  }\n \n  return {\n    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\nIf the redirects are known at build-time, they should be added in next.config.js instead.\nReading files: Use process.cwd()\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFiles can be read directly from the filesystem in getStaticProps.\nIn order to do so you have to get the full path to a file.\nSince Next.js compiles your code into a separate directory you can't use __dirname as the path it returns will be different from the Pages Router.\nInstead you can use process.cwd() which gives you the directory where Next.js is being executed.\nimport { promises as fs } from 'fs'\nimport path from 'path'\n \n// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()\nfunction Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li>\n          <h3>{post.filename}</h3>\n          <p>{post.content}</p>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do\n// direct database queries.\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts')\n  const filenames = await fs.readdir(postsDirectory)\n \n  const posts = filenames.map(async (filename) => {\n    const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, filename)\n    const fileContents = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8')\n \n    // Generally you would parse/transform the contents\n    // For example you can transform markdown to HTML here\n \n    return {\n      filename,\n      content: fileContents,\n    }\n  })\n  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts: await Promise.all(posts),\n    },\n  }\n}\n \nexport default Blog\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv13.4.0App Router is now stable with simplified data fetchingv12.2.0On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration is stable.v12.1.0On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration added (beta).v10.0.0locale, locales, defaultLocale, and notFound options added.v10.0.0fallback: 'blocking' return option added.v9.5.0Stable Incremental Static Regenerationv9.3.0getStaticProps introduced."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_api-reference_functions_next-request.txt","text":"NextRequest\nNextRequest extends the Web Request API with additional convenience methods.\ncookies\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nRead or mutate the Set-Cookie header of the request.\nset(name, value)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nGiven a name, set a cookie with the given value on the request.\n// Given incoming request /home\n// Set a cookie to hide the banner\n// request will have a `Set-Cookie:show-banner=false;path=/home` header\nrequest.cookies.set('show-banner', 'false')\nget(name)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nGiven a cookie name, return the value of the cookie.

See related docs for use case with automatically statically optimized pages\nisPreview: boolean - Whether the application is currently in preview mode.\n\n\nUsing the asPath field may lead to a mismatch between client and server if the page is rendered using server-side rendering or automatic static optimization. Avoid using asPath until the isReady field is true.\n\nThe following methods are included inside router:\nrouter.push\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nHandles client-side transitions, this method is useful for cases where next/link is not enough.\nrouter.push(url, as, options)\n\nurl: UrlObject | String - The URL to navigate to (see Node.JS URL module documentation for UrlObject properties).\nas: UrlObject | String - Optional decorator for the path that will be shown in the browser URL bar. Before Next.js 9.5.3 this was used for dynamic routes.\noptions - Optional object with the following configuration options:\n\nscroll - Optional boolean, controls scrolling to the top of the page after navigation. Defaults to true\nshallow: Update the path of the current page without rerunning getStaticProps, getServerSideProps or getInitialProps. Defaults to false\nlocale - Optional string, indicates locale of the new page\n\n\n\n\nYou don't need to use router.push for external URLs. window.location is better suited for those cases.\n\nNavigating to pages/about.js, which is a predefined route:\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  )\n}\nNavigating pages/post/[pid].js, which is a dynamic route:\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/post/abc')}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  )\n}\nRedirecting the user to pages/login.js, useful for pages behind authentication:\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \n// Here you would fetch and return the user\nconst useUser = () => ({ user: null, loading: false })\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const { user, loading } = useUser()\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!(user || loading)) {\n      router.push('/login')\n    }\n  }, [user, loading])\n \n  return <p>Redirecting...</p>\n}\nResetting state after navigation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen navigating to the same page in Next.js, the page's state will not be reset by default as React does not unmount unless the parent component has changed.\npages/[slug].jsimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page(props) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Page: {router.query.slug}</h1>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase count</button>\n      <Link href=\"/one\">one</Link> <Link href=\"/two\">two</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nIn the above example, navigating between /one and /two will not reset the count . The useState is maintained between renders because the top-level React component, Page, is the same.\nIf you do not want this behavior, you have a couple of options:\n\n\nManually ensure each state is updated using useEffect. In the above example, that could look like:\nuseEffect(() => {\n  setCount(0)\n}, [router.query.slug])\n\n\nUse a React key to tell React to remount the component. To do this for all pages, you can use a custom app:\npages/_app.jsimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  return <Component key={router.asPath} {...pageProps} />\n}\n\n\nWith URL object\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use a URL object in the same way you can use it for next/link. Works for both the url and as parameters:\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function ReadMore({ post }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button\n      type=\"button\"\n      onClick={() => {\n        router.push({\n          pathname: '/post/[pid]',\n          query: { pid: post.id },\n        })\n      }}\n    >\n      Click here to read more\n    </button>\n  )\n}\nrouter.replace\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSimilar to the replace prop in next/link, router.replace will prevent adding a new URL entry into the history stack.\nrouter.replace(url, as, options)\n\nThe API for router.replace is exactly the same as the API for router.push.\n\nTake a look at the following example:\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.replace('/home')}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  )\n}\nrouter.prefetch\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPrefetch pages for faster client-side transitions. This method is only useful for navigations without next/link, as next/link takes care of prefetching pages automatically.\n\nThis is a production only feature. Next.js doesn't prefetch pages in development.\n\nrouter.prefetch(url, as, options)\n\nurl - The URL to prefetch, including explicit routes (e.g. /dashboard) and dynamic routes (e.g. /product/[id])\nas - Optional decorator for url. Before Next.js 9.5.3 this was used to prefetch dynamic routes.\noptions - Optional object with the following allowed fields:\n\nlocale - allows providing a different locale from the active one. If false, url has to include the locale as the active locale won't be used.\n\n\n\nLet's say you have a login page, and after a login, you redirect the user to the dashboard. For that case, we can prefetch the dashboard to make a faster transition, like in the following example:\nimport { useCallback, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Login() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((e) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n \n    fetch('/api/login', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        /* Form data */\n      }),\n    }).then((res) => {\n      // Do a fast client-side transition to the already prefetched dashboard page\n      if (res.ok) router.push('/dashboard')\n    })\n  }, [])\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Prefetch the dashboard page\n    router.prefetch('/dashboard')\n  }, [router])\n \n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      {/* Form fields */}\n      <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\nrouter.beforePopState\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn some cases (for example, if using a Custom Server), you may wish to listen to popstate and do something before the router acts on it.\nrouter.beforePopState(cb)\n\ncb - The function to run on incoming popstate events. The function receives the state of the event as an object with the following props:\n\nurl: String - the route for the new state. This is usually the name of a page\nas: String - the url that will be shown in the browser\noptions: Object - Additional options sent by router.push\n\n\n\nIf cb returns false, the Next.js router will not handle popstate, and you'll be responsible for handling it in that case. See Disabling file-system routing.\nYou could use beforePopState to manipulate the request, or force a SSR refresh, as in the following example:\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    router.beforePopState(({ url, as, options }) => {\n      // I only want to allow these two routes!\n      if (as !== '/' && as !== '/other') {\n        // Have SSR render bad routes as a 404.\n        window.location.href = as\n        return false\n      }\n \n      return true\n    })\n  }, [router])\n \n  return <p>Welcome to the page</p>\n}\nrouter.back\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNavigate back in history. Equivalent to clicking the browser’s back button. It executes window.history.back().\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.back()}>\n      Click here to go back\n    </button>\n  )\n}\nrouter.reload\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nReload the current URL. Equivalent to clicking the browser’s refresh button. It executes window.location.reload().\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.reload()}>\n      Click here to reload\n    </button>\n  )\n}\nrouter.events\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can listen to different events happening inside the Next.js Router. Here's a list of supported events:\n\nrouteChangeStart(url, { shallow }) - Fires when a route starts to change\nrouteChangeComplete(url, { shallow }) - Fires when a route changed completely\nrouteChangeError(err, url, { shallow }) - Fires when there's an error when changing routes, or a route load is cancelled\n\nerr.cancelled - Indicates if the navigation was cancelled\n\n\nbeforeHistoryChange(url, { shallow }) - Fires before changing the browser's history\nhashChangeStart(url, { shallow }) - Fires when the hash will change but not the page\nhashChangeComplete(url, { shallow }) - Fires when the hash has changed but not the page\n\n\nGood to know: Here url is the URL shown in the browser, including the basePath.\n\nFor example, to listen to the router event routeChangeStart, open or create pages/_app.js and subscribe to the event, like so:\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleRouteChange = (url, { shallow }) => {\n      console.log(\n        `App is changing to ${url} ${\n          shallow ? 'with' : 'without'\n        } shallow routing`\n      )\n    }\n \n    router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n \n    // If the component is unmounted, unsubscribe\n    // from the event with the `off` method:\n    return () => {\n      router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n    }\n  }, [router])\n \n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n\nWe use a Custom App (pages/_app.js) for this example to subscribe to the event because it's not unmounted on page navigations, but you can subscribe to router events on any component in your application.\n\nRouter events should be registered when a component mounts (useEffect or componentDidMount / componentWillUnmount) or imperatively when an event happens.\nIf a route load is cancelled (for example, by clicking two links rapidly in succession), routeChangeError will fire. And the passed err will contain a cancelled property set to true, as in the following example:\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleRouteChangeError = (err, url) => {\n      if (err.cancelled) {\n        console.log(`Route to ${url} was cancelled!`)\n      }\n    }\n \n    router.events.on('routeChangeError', handleRouteChangeError)\n \n    // If the component is unmounted, unsubscribe\n    // from the event with the `off` method:\n    return () => {\n      router.events.off('routeChangeError', handleRouteChangeError)\n    }\n  }, [router])\n \n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\nPotential ESLint errors\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCertain methods accessible on the router object return a Promise. If you have the ESLint rule, no-floating-promises enabled, consider disabling it either globally, or for the affected line.\nIf your application needs this rule, you should either void the promise – or use an async function, await the Promise, then void the function call. This is not applicable when the method is called from inside an onClick handler.\nThe affected methods are:\n\nrouter.push\nrouter.replace\nrouter.prefetch\n\nPotential solutions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \n// Here you would fetch and return the user\nconst useUser = () => ({ user: null, loading: false })\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const { user, loading } = useUser()\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // disable the linting on the next line - This is the cleanest solution\n    // eslint-disable-next-line no-floating-promises\n    router.push('/login')\n \n    // void the Promise returned by router.push\n    if (!(user || loading)) {\n      void router.push('/login')\n    }\n    // or use an async function, await the Promise, then void the function call\n    async function handleRouteChange() {\n      if (!(user || loading)) {\n        await router.push('/login')\n      }\n    }\n    void handleRouteChange()\n  }, [user, loading])\n \n  return <p>Redirecting...</p>\n}\nwithRouter\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf useRouter is not the best fit for you, withRouter can also add the same router object to any component.\nUsage\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nimport { withRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nfunction Page({ router }) {\n  return <p>{router.pathname}</p>\n}\n \nexport default withRouter(Page)\nTypeScript\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo use class components with withRouter, the component needs to accept a router prop:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { withRouter, NextRouter } from 'next/router'\n \ninterface WithRouterProps {\n  router: NextRouter\n}\n \ninterface MyComponentProps extends WithRouterProps {}\n \nclass MyComponent extends React.Component<MyComponentProps> {\n  render() {\n    return <p>{this.props.router.pathname}</p>\n  }\n}\n \nexport default withRouter(MyComponent)"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_api-reference_functions_userAgent.txt","text":"userAgent\nThe userAgent helper extends the Web Request API with additional properties and methods to interact with the user agent object from the request.\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextRequest, NextResponse, userAgent } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const url = request.nextUrl\n  const { device } = userAgent(request)\n  const viewport = device.type === 'mobile' ?

This can prevent XSS exploits for websites that allow users to upload and share files.\nFor example, a user trying to download an image, but having it treated as a different Content-Type like an executable, which could be malicious.

Previously, when deploying with Docker you would need to have all files from your package's dependencies installed to run next start. Starting with Next.js 12, you can leverage Output File Tracing in the .next/ directory to only include the necessary files.\nFurthermore, this removes the need for the deprecated serverless target which can cause various issues and also creates unnecessary duplication.\nHow it Works\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDuring next build, Next.js will use @vercel/nft to statically analyze import, require, and fs usage to determine all files that a page might load.\nNext.js' production server is also traced for its needed files and output at .next/next-server.js.nft.json which can be leveraged in production.\nTo leverage the .nft.json files emitted to the .next output directory, you can read the list of files in each trace that are relative to the .nft.json file and then copy them to your deployment location.\nAutomatically Copying Traced Files\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can automatically create a standalone folder that copies only the necessary files for a production deployment including select files in node_modules.\nTo leverage this automatic copying you can enable it in your next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  output: 'standalone',\n}\nThis will create a folder at .next/standalone which can then be deployed on its own without installing node_modules.\nAdditionally, a minimal server.js file is also output which can be used instead of next start. This minimal server does not copy the public or .next/static folders by default as these should ideally be handled by a CDN instead, although these folders can be copied to the standalone/public and standalone/.next/static folders manually, after which server.js file will serve these automatically.\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nnext.config.js is read during next build and serialized into the server.js output file. If the legacy serverRuntimeConfig or publicRuntimeConfig options are being used, the values will be specific to values at build time.\nIf your project needs to listen to a specific port or hostname, you can define PORT or HOSTNAME environment variables before running server.js. For example, run PORT=8080 HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 node server.js to start the server on http://0.0.0.0:8080.\nIf your project uses Image Optimization with the default loader, you must install sharp as a dependency:\n\n\nTerminalnpm i sharp\nTerminalyarn add sharp\nTerminalpnpm add sharp\nTerminalbun add sharp\nCaveats\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWhile tracing in monorepo setups, the project directory is used for tracing by default. For next build packages/web-app, packages/web-app would be the tracing root and any files outside of that folder will not be included. To include files outside of this folder you can set experimental.outputFileTracingRoot in your next.config.js.\n\npackages/web-app/next.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    // this includes files from the monorepo base two directories up\n    outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname, '../../'),\n  },\n}\n\nThere are some cases in which Next.js might fail to include required files, or might incorrectly include unused files. In those cases, you can leverage experimental.outputFileTracingExcludes and experimental.outputFileTracingIncludes respectively in next.config.js. Each config accepts an object with minimatch globs for the key to match specific pages and a value of an array with globs relative to the project's root to either include or exclude in the trace.\n\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    outputFileTracingExcludes: {\n      '/api/hello': ['./un-necessary-folder/**/*'],\n    },\n    outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n      '/api/another': ['./necessary-folder/**/*'],\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nCurrently, Next.js does not do anything with the emitted .nft.json files. The files must be read by your deployment platform, for example Vercel, to create a minimal deployment. In a future release, a new command is planned to utilize these .nft.json files.\n\nExperimental turbotrace\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTracing dependencies can be slow because it requires very complex computations and analysis. We created turbotrace in Rust as a faster and smarter alternative to the JavaScript implementation.\nTo enable it, you can add the following configuration to your next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbotrace: {\n      // control the log level of the turbotrace, default is `error`\n      logLevel?:\n      | 'bug'\n      | 'fatal'\n      | 'error'\n      | 'warning'\n      | 'hint'\n      | 'note'\n      | 'suggestions'\n      | 'info',\n      // control if the log of turbotrace should contain the details of the analysis, default is `false`\n      logDetail?: boolean\n      // show all log messages without limit\n      // turbotrace only show 1 log message for each categories by default\n      logAll?: boolean\n      // control the context directory of the turbotrace\n      // files outside of the context directory will not be traced\n      // set the `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot` has the same effect\n      // if the `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot` and this option are both set, the `experimental.turbotrace.contextDirectory` will be used\n      contextDirectory?: string\n      // if there is `process.cwd()` expression in your code, you can set this option to tell `turbotrace` the value of `process.cwd()` while tracing.\n      // for example the require(process.cwd() + '/package.json') will be traced as require('/path/to/cwd/package.json')\n      processCwd?: string\n      // control the maximum memory usage of the `turbotrace`, in `MB`, default is `6000`.\n      memoryLimit?: number\n    },\n  },\n}"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_api-reference_next-config-js_pageExtensions.txt","text":"pageExtensions\n\nYou can extend the default Page extensions (.tsx, .ts, .jsx, .js) used by Next.js.

Traditionally a 302 was used for a temporary redirect, and a 301 for a permanent redirect, but many browsers changed the request method of the redirect to GET, regardless of the original method. For example, if the browser made a request to POST /v1/users which returned status code 302 with location /v2/users, the subsequent request might be GET /v2/users instead of the expected POST /v2/users. Next.js uses the 307 temporary redirect, and 308 permanent redirect status codes to explicitly preserve the request method used.\n\n\nbasePath: false or undefined - if false the basePath won't be included when matching, can be used for external redirects only.\nlocale: false or undefined - whether the locale should not be included when matching.\nhas is an array of has objects with the type, key and value properties.\nmissing is an array of missing objects with the type, key and value properties.\n\nRedirects are checked before the filesystem which includes pages and /public files.\nWhen using the Pages Router, redirects are not applied to client-side routing (Link, router.push) unless Middleware is present and matches the path.\nWhen a redirect is applied, any query values provided in the request will be passed through to the redirect destination.

In contrast, redirects will reroute to a new page and show the URL changes.\nTo use rewrites you can use the rewrites key in next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        destination: '/',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nRewrites are applied to client-side routing, a <Link href=\"/about\"> will have the rewrite applied in the above example.\nrewrites is an async function that expects to return either an array or an object of arrays (see below) holding objects with source and destination properties:\n\nsource: String - is the incoming request path pattern.\ndestination: String is the path you want to route to.\nbasePath: false or undefined - if false the basePath won't be included when matching, can be used for external rewrites only.\nlocale: false or undefined - whether the locale should not be included when matching.\nhas is an array of has objects with the type, key and value properties.\nmissing is an array of missing objects with the type, key and value properties.\n\nWhen the rewrites function returns an array, rewrites are applied after checking the filesystem (pages and /public files) and before dynamic routes.

Turbopack has built-in support for css and compiling modern JavaScript, so there's no need for css-loader, postcss-loader, or babel-loader if you're using @babel/preset-env.\n\n\nwebpack loaders\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you need loader support beyond what's built in, many webpack loaders already work with Turbopack. There are currently some limitations:\n\nOnly a core subset of the webpack loader API is implemented. Currently, there is enough coverage for some popular loaders, and we'll expand our API support in the future.\nOnly loaders that return JavaScript code are supported. Loaders that transform files like stylesheets or images are not currently supported.\nOptions passed to webpack loaders must be plain JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays. For example, it's not possible to pass require()d plugin modules as option values.\n\nTo configure loaders, add the names of the loaders you've installed and any options in next.config.js, mapping file extensions to a list of loaders:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      rules: {\n        '*.svg': {\n          loaders: ['@svgr/webpack'],\n          as: '*.js',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: Prior to Next.js version 13.4.4, experimental.turbo.rules was named experimental.turbo.loaders and only accepted file extensions like .mdx instead of *.mdx.\n\nSupported loaders\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following loaders have been tested to work with Turbopack's webpack loader implementation:\n\nbabel-loader\n@svgr/webpack\nsvg-inline-loader\nyaml-loader\nstring-replace-loader\nraw-loader\n'sass-loader'\n\nResolve aliases\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThrough next.config.js, Turbopack can be configured to modify module resolution through aliases, similar to webpack's resolve.alias configuration.\nTo configure resolve aliases, map imported patterns to their new destination in next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      resolveAlias: {\n        underscore: 'lodash',\n        mocha: { browser: 'mocha/browser-entry.js' },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\nThis aliases imports of the underscore package to the lodash package. In other words, import underscore from 'underscore' will load the lodash module instead of underscore.\nTurbopack also supports conditional aliasing through this field, similar to Node.js's conditional exports. At the moment only the browser condition is supported. In the case above, imports of the mocha module will be aliased to mocha/browser-entry.js when Turbopack targets browser environments.\nResolve extensions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThrough next.config.js, Turbopack can be configured to resolve modules with custom extensions, similar to webpack's resolve.extensions configuration.\nTo configure resolve extensions, use the resolveExtensions field in next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      resolveExtensions: [\n        '.mdx',\n        '.tsx',\n        '.ts',\n        '.jsx',\n        '.js',\n        '.mjs',\n        '.json',\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n}\nThis overwrites the original resolve extensions with the provided list.

It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password.\nSession Management tracks the user's state (e.g. logged in) across multiple requests.\nAuthorization decides what parts of the application the user is allowed to access.\n\nThis page demonstrates how to use Next.js features to implement common authentication, authorization, and session management patterns so you can choose the best solutions based on your application's needs.\nAuthentication\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAuthentication verifies a user's identity. This happens when a user logs in, either with a username and password or through a service like Google. It's all about confirming that users are really who they claim to be, protecting both the user's data and the application from unauthorized access or fraudulent activities.\nAuthentication Strategies\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nModern web applications commonly use several authentication strategies:\n\nOAuth/OpenID Connect (OIDC): Enable third-party access without sharing user credentials. Ideal for social media logins and Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions. They add an identity layer with OpenID Connect.\nCredentials-based login (Email + Password): A standard choice for web applications, where users log in with an email and password. Familiar and easy to implement, it requires robust security measures against threats like phishing.\nPasswordless/Token-based authentication: Use email magic links or SMS one-time codes for secure, password-free access. Popular for its convenience and enhanced security, this method helps reduce password fatigue. Its limitation is the dependency on the user's email or phone availability.\nPasskeys/WebAuthn: Use cryptographic credentials unique to each site, offering high security against phishing. Secure but new, this strategy can be difficult to implement.\n\nSelecting an authentication strategy should align with your application's specific requirements, user interface considerations, and security objectives.\nImplementing Authentication\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn this section, we'll explore the process of adding basic email-password authentication to a web application. While this method provides a fundamental level of security, it's worth considering more advanced options like OAuth or passwordless logins for enhanced protection against common security threats. The authentication flow we'll discuss is as follows:\n\nThe user submits their credentials through a login form.\nThe form sends a request that is handled by an API route.\nUpon successful verification, the process is completed, indicating the user's successful authentication.\nIf verification is unsuccessful, an error message is shown.\nConsider a login form where users can input their credentials:pages/login.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { FormEvent } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function LoginPage() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  async function handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n \n    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n    const email = formData.get('email')\n    const password = formData.get('password')\n \n    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),\n    })\n \n    if (response.ok) {\n      router.push('/profile')\n    } else {\n      // Handle errors\n    }\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" required />\n      <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}The form above has two input fields for capturing the user's email and password. On submission, it triggers a function that sends a POST request to an API route (/api/auth/login).You can then call your Authentication Provider's API in the API route to handle authentication:pages/api/auth/login.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\nimport { signIn } from '@/auth'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const { email, password } = req.body\n    await signIn('credentials', { email, password })\n \n    res.status(200).json({ success: true })\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.type === 'CredentialsSignin') {\n      res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials.' })\n    } else {\n      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong.' })\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn this code, the signIn method checks the credentials against stored user data.\nAfter the authentication provider processes the credentials, there are two possible outcomes:\n\nSuccessful Authentication: This outcome implies that the login was successful. Further actions, such as accessing protected routes and fetching user information, can then be initiated.\nFailed Authentication: In cases where the credentials are incorrect or an error is encountered, the function returns a corresponding error message to indicate the authentication failure.\n\n\nFor a more streamlined authentication setup in Next.js projects, especially when offering multiple login methods, consider using a comprehensive authentication solution.\nAuthorization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOnce a user is authenticated, you'll need to ensure the user is allowed to visit certain routes, and perform operations such as mutating data with Server Actions and calling Route Handlers.\nProtecting Routes with Middleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware in Next.js helps you control who can access different parts of your website. This is important for keeping areas like the user dashboard protected while having other pages like marketing pages be public. It's recommended to apply Middleware across all routes and specify exclusions for public access.\nHere's how to implement Middleware for authentication in Next.js:\nSetting Up Middleware:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nCreate a middleware.ts or .js file in your project's root directory.\nInclude logic to authorize user access, such as checking for authentication tokens.\n\nDefining Protected Routes:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nNot all routes require authorization. Use the matcher option in your Middleware to specify any routes that do not require authorization checks.\n\nMiddleware Logic:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWrite logic to verify if a user is authenticated. Check user roles or permissions for route authorization.\n\nHandling Unauthorized Access:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nRedirect unauthorized users to a login or error page as appropriate.\n\nExample Middleware file:\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const currentUser = request.cookies.get('currentUser')?.value\n \n  if (currentUser && !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {\n    return Response.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', request.url))\n  }\n \n  if (!currentUser && !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/login')) {\n    return Response.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))\n  }\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)'],\n}\n\nThis example uses Response.redirect for handling redirects early in the request pipeline, making it efficient and centralizing access control.\n\nAfter successful authentication, it's important to manage user navigation based on their roles. For example, an admin user might be redirected to an admin dashboard, while a regular user is sent to a different page. This is important for role-specific experiences and conditional navigation, such as prompting users to complete their profile if needed.\nWhen setting up authorization, it's important to ensure that the main security checks happen where your app accesses or changes data. While Middleware can be useful for initial validation, it should not be the sole line of defense in protecting your data. The bulk of security checks should be performed in the Data Access Layer (DAL).\nProtecting API Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \nAPI Routes in Next.js are essential for handling server-side logic and data management. It's crucial to secure these routes to ensure that only authorized users can access specific functionalities. This typically involves verifying the user's authentication status and their role-based permissions.Here's an example of securing an API Route:pages/api/route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const session = await getSession(req)\n \n  // Check if the user is authenticated\n  if (!session) {\n    res.status(401).json({\n      error: 'User is not authenticated',\n    })\n    return\n  }\n \n  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n  if (session.user.role !== 'admin') {\n    res.status(401).json({\n      error: 'Unauthorized access: User does not have admin privileges.',\n    })\n    return\n  }\n \n  // Proceed with the route for authorized users\n  // ... implementation of the API Route\n}This example demonstrates an API Route with a two-tier security check for authentication and authorization. It first checks for an active session, and then verifies if the logged-in user is an 'admin'. This approach ensures secure access, limited to authenticated and authorized users, maintaining robust security for request processing.\n\nBest Practices\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nSecure Session Management: Prioritize the security of session data to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Use encryption and secure storage practices.\nDynamic Role Management: Use a flexible system for user roles to easily adjust to changes in permissions and roles, avoiding hardcoded roles.\nSecurity-First Approach: In all aspects of authorization logic, prioritize security to safeguard user data and maintain the integrity of your application. This includes thorough testing and considering potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nSession Management\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSession management involves tracking and managing a user's interaction with the application over time, ensuring that their authenticated state is preserved across different parts of the application.\nThis prevents the need for repeated logins, enhancing both security and user convenience. There are two primary methods used for session management: cookie-based and database sessions.\nCookie-Based Sessions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n🎥 Watch: Learn more about cookie-based sessions and authentication with Next.js → YouTube (11 minutes).\n\nCookie-based sessions manage user data by storing encrypted session information directly in browser cookies. Upon user login, this encrypted data is stored in the cookie. Each subsequent server request includes this cookie, minimizing the need for repeated server queries and enhancing client-side efficiency.\nHowever, this method requires careful encryption to protect sensitive data, as cookies are susceptible to client-side security risks. Encrypting session data in cookies is key to safeguarding user information from unauthorized access. It ensures that even if a cookie is stolen, the data inside remains unreadable.\nAdditionally, while individual cookies are limited in size (typically around 4KB), techniques like cookie-chunking can overcome this limitation by dividing large session data into multiple cookies.\nSetting a cookie in a Next.js project might look something like this:\nSetting a cookie on the server:\npages/api/login.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { serialize } from 'cookie'\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const sessionData = req.body\n  const encryptedSessionData = encrypt(sessionData)\n \n  const cookie = serialize('session', encryptedSessionData, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',\n    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // One week\n    path: '/',\n  })\n  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', cookie)\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Successfully set cookie!' })\n}\n\nDatabase Sessions\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDatabase session management involves storing session data on the server, with the user's browser only receiving a session ID. This ID references the session data stored server-side, without containing the data itself. This method enhances security, as it keeps sensitive session data away from the client-side environment, reducing the risk of exposure to client-side attacks. Database sessions are also more scalable, accommodating larger data storage needs.\nHowever, this approach has its tradeoffs. It can increase performance overhead due to the need for database lookups at each user interaction. Strategies like session data caching can help mitigate this. Additionally, reliance on the database means that session management is as reliable as the database's performance and availability.\nHere's a simplified example of implementing database sessions in a Next.js application:\nCreating a Session on the Server:\npages/api/create-session.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport db from '../../lib/db'\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const user = req.body\n    const sessionId = generateSessionId()\n    await db.insertSession({\n      sessionId,\n      userId: user.id,\n      createdAt: new Date(),\n    })\n \n    res.status(200).json({ sessionId })\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' })\n  }\n}\n\nSelecting Session Management in Next.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDeciding between cookie-based and database sessions in Next.js depends on your application's needs. Cookie-based sessions are simpler and suit smaller applications with lower server load but may offer less security. Database sessions, while more complex, provide better security and scalability, ideal for larger, data-sensitive applications.\nWith authentication solutions such as NextAuth.js, session management becomes more efficient, using either cookies or database storage. This automation simplifies the development process, but it's important to understand the session management method used by your chosen solution. Ensure it aligns with your application's security and performance requirements.\nRegardless of your choice, prioritize security in your session management strategy. For cookie-based sessions, using secure and HTTP-only cookies is crucial to protect session data. For database sessions, regular backups and secure handling of session data are essential. Implementing session expiry and cleanup mechanisms is vital in both approaches to prevent unauthorized access and maintain application performance and reliability.\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nHere are authentication solutions compatible with Next.js, please refer to the quickstart guides below to learn how to configure them in your Next.js application:\n\n\nAuth0\nClerk\nKinde\nLucia\nNextAuth.js\nSupabase\nStytch\nIron Session\n\nFurther Reading\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo continue learning about authentication and security, check out the following resources:\n\nUnderstanding XSS Attacks\nUnderstanding CSRF Attacks\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_configuring.txt","text":"Configuring\nNext.js allows you to customize your project to meet specific requirements.

CSS Modules aren't supported by AMP pages at the moment. You can contribute CSS Modules support to Next.js.\n\nAdding AMP Components\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe AMP community provides many components to make AMP pages more interactive. Next.js will automatically import all components used on a page and there is no need to manually import AMP component scripts:\nexport const config = { amp: true }\n \nfunction MyAmpPage() {\n  const date = new Date()\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Some time: {date.toJSON()}</p>\n      <amp-timeago\n        width=\"0\"\n        height=\"15\"\n        datetime={date.toJSON()}\n        layout=\"responsive\"\n      >\n        .\n      </amp-timeago>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default MyAmpPage\nThe above example uses the amp-timeago component.\nBy default, the latest version of a component is always imported. If you want to customize the version, you can use next/head, as in the following example:\nimport Head from 'next/head'\n \nexport const config = { amp: true }\n \nfunction MyAmpPage() {\n  const date = new Date()\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Head>\n        <script\n          async\n          key=\"amp-timeago\"\n          custom-element=\"amp-timeago\"\n          src=\"https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-timeago-0.1.js\"\n        />\n      </Head>\n \n      <p>Some time: {date.toJSON()}</p>\n      <amp-timeago\n        width=\"0\"\n        height=\"15\"\n        datetime={date.toJSON()}\n        layout=\"responsive\"\n      >\n        .\n      </amp-timeago>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default MyAmpPage\nAMP Validation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAMP pages are automatically validated with amphtml-validator during development. Errors and warnings will appear in the terminal where you started Next.js.\nPages are also validated during Static HTML export and any warnings / errors will be printed to the terminal. Any AMP errors will cause the export to exit with status code 1 because the export is not valid AMP.\nCustom Validators\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can set up custom AMP validator in next.config.js as shown below:\nmodule.exports = {\n  amp: {\n    validator: './custom_validator.js',\n  },\n}\nSkip AMP Validation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo turn off AMP validation add the following code to next.config.js\nexperimental: {\n  amp: {\n    skipValidation: true\n  }\n}\nAMP in Static HTML Export\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen using Static HTML export statically prerender pages, Next.js will detect if the page supports AMP and change the exporting behavior based on that.\nFor example, the hybrid AMP page pages/about.js would output:\n\nout/about.html - HTML page with client-side React runtime\nout/about.amp.html - AMP page\n\nAnd if pages/about.js is an AMP-only page, then it would output:\n\nout/about.html - Optimized AMP page\n\nNext.js will automatically insert a link to the AMP version of your page in the HTML version, so you don't have to, like so:\n<link rel=\"amphtml\" href=\"/about.amp.html\" />\nAnd the AMP version of your page will include a link to the HTML page:\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"/about\" />\nWhen trailingSlash is enabled the exported pages for pages/about.js would be:\n\nout/about/index.html - HTML page\nout/about.amp/index.html - AMP page\n\nTypeScript\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAMP currently doesn't have built-in types for TypeScript, but it's in their roadmap (#13791).\nAs a workaround you can manually create a file called amp.d.ts inside your project and add these custom types."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_configuring_babel.txt","text":"BabelExamples\nCustomizing babel configuration\n\nNext.js includes the next/babel preset to your app, which includes everything needed to compile React applications and server-side code.

It is used in conjunction with CSP to selectively allow certain inline scripts or styles to execute, bypassing strict CSP directives.\nWhy use a nonce?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nEven though CSPs are designed to block malicious scripts, there are legitimate scenarios where inline scripts are necessary. In such cases, nonces offer a way to allow these scripts to execute if they have the correct nonce.\nAdding a nonce with Middleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware enables you to add headers and generate nonces before the page renders.\nEvery time a page is viewed, a fresh nonce should be generated. This means that you must use dynamic rendering to add nonces.\nFor example:\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const nonce = Buffer.from(crypto.randomUUID()).toString('base64')\n  const cspHeader = `\n    default-src 'self';\n    script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic';\n    style-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}';\n    img-src 'self' blob: data:;\n    font-src 'self';\n    object-src 'none';\n    base-uri 'self';\n    form-action 'self';\n    frame-ancestors 'none';\n    upgrade-insecure-requests;\n`\n  // Replace newline characters and spaces\n  const contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue = cspHeader\n    .replace(/\\s{2,}/g, ' ')\n    .trim()\n \n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n  requestHeaders.set('x-nonce', nonce)\n \n  requestHeaders.set(\n    'Content-Security-Policy',\n    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue\n  )\n \n  const response = NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      headers: requestHeaders,\n    },\n  })\n  response.headers.set(\n    'Content-Security-Policy',\n    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue\n  )\n \n  return response\n}\n\nBy default, Middleware runs on all requests.

Most of the time, you will not need this - but it's available for complete customization.\n\nGood to know:\n\nBefore deciding to use a custom server, please keep in mind that it should only be used when the integrated router of Next.js can't meet your app requirements. A custom server will remove important performance optimizations, like serverless functions and Automatic Static Optimization.\nA custom server cannot be deployed on Vercel.\nStandalone output mode, does not trace custom server files and this mode outputs a separate minimal server.js file instead.\n\n\nTake a look at the following example of a custom server:\nserver.jsconst { createServer } = require('http')\nconst { parse } = require('url')\nconst next = require('next')\n \nconst dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'\nconst hostname = 'localhost'\nconst port = 3000\n// when using middleware `hostname` and `port` must be provided below\nconst app = next({ dev, hostname, port })\nconst handle = app.getRequestHandler()\n \napp.prepare().then(() => {\n  createServer(async (req, res) => {\n    try {\n      // Be sure to pass `true` as the second argument to `url.parse`.\n      // This tells it to parse the query portion of the URL.\n      const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true)\n      const { pathname, query } = parsedUrl\n \n      if (pathname === '/a') {\n        await app.render(req, res, '/a', query)\n      } else if (pathname === '/b') {\n        await app.render(req, res, '/b', query)\n      } else {\n        await handle(req, res, parsedUrl)\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Error occurred handling', req.url, err)\n      res.statusCode = 500\n      res.end('internal server error')\n    }\n  })\n    .once('error', (err) => {\n      console.error(err)\n      process.exit(1)\n    })\n    .listen(port, () => {\n      console.log(`> Ready on http://${hostname}:${port}`)\n    })\n})\n\nserver.js doesn't go through babel or webpack. Make sure the syntax and sources this file requires are compatible with the current node version you are running.\n\nTo run the custom server you'll need to update the scripts in package.json like so:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"node server.js\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"NODE_ENV=production node server.js\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe custom server uses the following import to connect the server with the Next.js application:\nconst next = require('next')\nconst app = next({})\nThe above next import is a function that receives an object with the following options:\nOptionTypeDescriptionconfObjectThe same object you would use in next.config.js.

If your project uses a custom server, this behavior may result in the same content being served from multiple paths, which can present problems with SEO and UX.\nTo disable this behavior and prevent routing based on files in pages, open next.config.js and disable the useFileSystemPublicRoutes config:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  useFileSystemPublicRoutes: false,\n}\n\nNote that useFileSystemPublicRoutes disables filename routes from SSR; client-side routing may still access those paths. When using this option, you should guard against navigation to routes you do not want programmatically.\n\n\nYou may also wish to configure the client-side router to disallow client-side redirects to filename routes; for that refer to router.beforePopState.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_configuring_debugging.txt","text":"DebuggingThis documentation explains how you can debug your Next.js frontend and backend code with full source maps support using either the VS Code debugger or Chrome DevTools.\nAny debugger that can attach to Node.js can also be used to debug a Next.js application.

Note that when searching here, your source files will have paths starting with webpack://_N_E/./.\nServer-side code\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo debug server-side Next.js code with Chrome DevTools, you need to pass the --inspect flag to the underlying Node.js process:\nTerminalNODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\nIf you're using npm run dev or yarn dev then you should update the dev script on your package.json:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\"\n  }\n}\nLaunching the Next.js dev server with the --inspect flag will look something like this:\nTerminalDebugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/0cf90313-350d-4466-a748-cd60f4e47c95\nFor help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector\nready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000\n\nBe aware that running NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' npm run dev or NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' yarn dev won't work. This would try to start multiple debuggers on the same port: one for the npm/yarn process and one for Next.js. You would then get an error like Starting inspector on 127.0.0.1:9229 failed: address already in use in your console.\n\nOnce the server starts, open a new tab in Chrome and visit chrome://inspect, where you should see your Next.js application inside the Remote Target section. Click inspect under your application to open a separate DevTools window, then go to the Sources tab.\nDebugging server-side code here works much like debugging client-side code with Chrome DevTools, except that when you search for files here with Ctrl+P or ⌘+P, your source files will have paths starting with webpack://{application-name}/./ (where {application-name} will be replaced with the name of your application according to your package.json file).\nDebugging on Windows\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWindows users may run into an issue when using NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' as that syntax is not supported on Windows platforms. To get around this, install the cross-env package as a development dependency (-D with npm and yarn) and replace the dev script with the following.\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"cross-env NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\"\n  }\n}\ncross-env will set the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable regardless of which platform you are on (including Mac, Linux, and Windows) and allow you to debug consistently across devices and operating systems.\n\nGood to know: Ensure Windows Defender is disabled on your machine. This external service will check every file read, which has been reported to greatly increase Fast Refresh time with next dev. This is a known issue, not related to Next.js, but it does affect Next.js development.\n\nMore information\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo learn more about how to use a JavaScript debugger, take a look at the following documentation:\n\nNode.js debugging in VS Code: Breakpoints\nChrome DevTools: Debug JavaScript\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_configuring_draft-mode.txt","text":"Draft ModeIn the Pages documentation and the Data Fetching documentation, we talked about how to pre-render a page at build time (Static Generation) using getStaticProps and getStaticPaths.\nStatic Generation is useful when your pages fetch data from a headless CMS. However, it’s not ideal when you’re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to view the draft immediately on your page. You’d want Next.js to render these pages at request time instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You’d want Next.js to bypass Static Generation only for this specific case.\nNext.js has a feature called Draft Mode which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.\nStep 1: Create and access the API route\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nTake a look at the API Routes documentation first if you’re not familiar with Next.js API Routes.\n\nFirst, create the API route. It can have any name - e.g. pages/api/draft.ts\nIn this API route, you need to call setDraftMode on the response object.\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  // ...\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: true })\n  // ...\n}\nThis will set a cookie to enable draft mode. Subsequent requests containing this cookie will trigger Draft Mode changing the behavior for statically generated pages (more on this later).\nYou can test this manually by creating an API route like below and accessing it from your browser manually:\npages/api/draft.ts// simple example for testing it manually from your browser.\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: true })\n  res.end('Draft mode is enabled')\n}\nIf you open your browser’s developer tools and visit /api/draft, you’ll notice a Set-Cookie response header with a cookie named __prerender_bypass.\nSecurely accessing it from your Headless CMS\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn practice, you’d want to call this API route securely from your headless CMS. The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take.\nThese steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting custom draft URLs. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your draft URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the draft URL manually.\nFirst, you should create a secret token string using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing draft URLs.\nSecond, if your headless CMS supports setting custom draft URLs, specify the following as the draft URL. This assumes that your draft API route is located at pages/api/draft.ts.\nTerminalhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n\n<your-site> should be your deployment domain.\n<token> should be replaced with the secret token you generated.\n<path> should be the path for the page that you want to view. If you want to view /posts/foo, then you should use &slug=/posts/foo.\n\nYour headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the draft URL so that <path> can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: &slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}\nFinally, in the draft API route:\n\nCheck that the secret matches and that the slug parameter exists (if not, the request should fail).\n\nCall res.setDraftMode.\nThen redirect the browser to the path specified by slug. (The following example uses a 307 redirect).\n\nexport default async (req, res) => {\n  // Check the secret and next parameters\n  // This secret should only be known to this API route and the CMS\n  if (req.query.secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !req.query.slug) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' })\n  }\n \n  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists\n  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS\n  const post = await getPostBySlug(req.query.slug)\n \n  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent draft mode from being enabled\n  if (!post) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid slug' })\n  }\n \n  // Enable Draft Mode by setting the cookie\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: true })\n \n  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post\n  // We don't redirect to req.query.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities\n  res.redirect(post.slug)\n}\nIf it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to view with the draft mode cookie.\nStep 2: Update getStaticProps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe next step is to update getStaticProps to support draft mode.\nIf you request a page which has getStaticProps with the cookie set (via res.setDraftMode), then getStaticProps will be called at request time (instead of at build time).\nFurthermore, it will be called with a context object where context.draftMode will be true.\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  if (context.draftMode) {\n    // dynamic data\n  }\n}\nWe used res.setDraftMode in the draft API route, so context.draftMode will be true.\nIf you’re also using getStaticPaths, then context.params will also be available.\nFetch draft data\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can update getStaticProps to fetch different data based on context.draftMode.\nFor example, your headless CMS might have a different API endpoint for draft posts. If so, you can modify the API endpoint URL like below:\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  const url = context.draftMode\n    ? 'https://draft.example.com'\n    : 'https://production.example.com'\n  const res = await fetch(url)\n  // ...\n}\nThat’s it! If you access the draft API route (with secret and slug) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the draft content. And if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to view the draft.\nSet this as the draft URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the draft.\nTerminalhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\nMore Details\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nClear the Draft Mode cookie\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, the Draft Mode session ends when the browser is closed.\nTo clear the Draft Mode cookie manually, create an API route that calls setDraftMode({ enable: false }):\npages/api/disable-draft.tsexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: false })\n}\nThen, send a request to /api/disable-draft to invoke the API Route. If calling this route using next/link, you must pass prefetch={false} to prevent accidentally deleting the cookie on prefetch.\nWorks with getServerSideProps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDraft Mode works with getServerSideProps, and is available as a draftMode key in the context object.\n\nGood to know: You shouldn't set the Cache-Control header when using Draft Mode because it cannot be bypassed. Instead, we recommend using ISR.\n\nWorks with API Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAPI Routes will have access to draftMode on the request object. For example:\nexport default function myApiRoute(req, res) {\n  if (req.draftMode) {\n    // get draft data\n  }\n}\nUnique per next build\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA new bypass cookie value will be generated each time you run next build.\nThis ensures that the bypass cookie can’t be guessed.\n\nGood to know: To test Draft Mode locally over HTTP, your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_configuring_environment-variables.txt","text":"Environment Variables\nExamples\nEnvironment Variables\n\nNext.js comes with built-in support for environment variables, which allows you to do the following:\n\nUse .env.local to load environment variables\nBundle environment variables for the browser by prefixing with NEXT_PUBLIC_\n\nLoading Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has built-in support for loading environment variables from .env.local into process.env.\n.env.localDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_USER=myuser\nDB_PASS=mypassword\nThis loads process.env.DB_HOST, process.env.DB_USER, and process.env.DB_PASS into the Node.js environment automatically allowing you to use them in Next.js data fetching methods and API routes.For example, using getStaticProps:pages/index.jsexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const db = await myDB.connect({\n    host: process.env.DB_HOST,\n    username: process.env.DB_USER,\n    password: process.env.DB_PASS,\n  })\n  // ...\n}\n\nReferencing Other Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js will automatically expand variables that use $ to reference other variables e.g. $VARIABLE inside of your .env* files. This allows you to reference other secrets. For example:\n.envTWITTER_USER=nextjs\nTWITTER_URL=https://twitter.com/$TWITTER_USER\nIn the above example, process.env.TWITTER_URL would be set to https://twitter.com/nextjs.\n\nGood to know: If you need to use variable with a $ in the actual value, it needs to be escaped e.g. \\$.\n\nBundling Environment Variables for the Browser\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNon-NEXT_PUBLIC_ environment variables are only available in the Node.js environment, meaning they aren't accessible to the browser (the client runs in a different environment).\nIn order to make the value of an environment variable accessible in the browser, Next.js can \"inline\" a value, at build time, into the js bundle that is delivered to the client, replacing all references to process.env.[variable] with a hard-coded value. To tell it to do this, you just have to prefix the variable with NEXT_PUBLIC_. For example:\nTerminalNEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=abcdefghijk\nThis will tell Next.js to replace all references to process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID in the Node.js environment with the value from the environment in which you run next build, allowing you to use it anywhere in your code. It will be inlined into any JavaScript sent to the browser.\n\nNote: After being built, your app will no longer respond to changes to these environment variables. For instance, if you use a Heroku pipeline to promote slugs built in one environment to another environment, or if you build and deploy a single Docker image to multiple environments, all NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables will be frozen with the value evaluated at build time, so these values need to be set appropriately when the project is built. If you need access to runtime environment values, you'll have to setup your own API to provide them to the client (either on demand or during initialization).\n\npages/index.jsimport setupAnalyticsService from '../lib/my-analytics-service'\n \n// 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID' can be used here as it's prefixed by 'NEXT_PUBLIC_'.\n// It will be transformed at build time to `setupAnalyticsService('abcdefghijk')`.\nsetupAnalyticsService(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID)\n \nfunction HomePage() {\n  return <h1>Hello World</h1>\n}\n \nexport default HomePage\nNote that dynamic lookups will not be inlined, such as:\n// This will NOT be inlined, because it uses a variable\nconst varName = 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID'\nsetupAnalyticsService(process.env[varName])\n \n// This will NOT be inlined, because it uses a variable\nconst env = process.env\nsetupAnalyticsService(env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID)\nRuntime Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can support both build time and runtime environment variables.\nBy default, environment variables are only available on the server. To expose an environment variable to the browser, it must be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_. However, these public environment variables will be inlined into the JavaScript bundle during next build.\nTo read runtime environment variables, we recommend using getServerSideProps or incrementally adopting the App Router. With the App Router, we can safely read environment variables on the server during dynamic rendering. This allows you to use a singular Docker image that can be promoted through multiple environments with different values.\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default function Component() {\n  noStore()\n  // cookies(), headers(), and other dynamic functions\n  // will also opt into dynamic rendering, meaning\n  // this env variable is evaluated at runtime\n  const value = process.env.MY_VALUE\n  // ...\n}\nGood to know:\n\nYou can run code on server startup using the register function.\nWe do not recommend using the runtimeConfig option, as this does not work with the standalone output mode. Instead, we recommend incrementally adopting the App Router.\n\nDefault Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn general only one .env.local file is needed. However, sometimes you might want to add some defaults for the development (next dev) or production (next start) environment.\nNext.js allows you to set defaults in .env (all environments), .env.development (development environment), and .env.production (production environment).\n.env.local always overrides the defaults set.\n\nGood to know: .env, .env.development, and .env.production files should be included in your repository as they define defaults. .env*.local should be added to .gitignore, as those files are intended to be ignored. .env.local is where secrets can be stored.\n\nEnvironment Variables on Vercel\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen deploying your Next.js application to Vercel, Environment Variables can be configured in the Project Settings.\nAll types of Environment Variables should be configured there. Even Environment Variables used in Development – which can be downloaded onto your local device afterwards.\nIf you've configured Development Environment Variables you can pull them into a .env.local for usage on your local machine using the following command:\nTerminalvercel env pull .env.local\n\nGood to know: When deploying your Next.js application to Vercel, your environment variables in .env* files will not be made available to Edge Runtime, unless their name are prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_. We strongly recommend managing your environment variables in Project Settings instead, from where all environment variables are available.\n\nTest Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nApart from development and production environments, there is a 3rd option available: test. In the same way you can set defaults for development or production environments, you can do the same with a .env.test file for the testing environment (though this one is not as common as the previous two). Next.js will not load environment variables from .env.development or .env.production in the testing environment.\nThis one is useful when running tests with tools like jest or cypress where you need to set specific environment vars only for testing purposes. Test default values will be loaded if NODE_ENV is set to test, though you usually don't need to do this manually as testing tools will address it for you.\nThere is a small difference between test environment, and both development and production that you need to bear in mind: .env.local won't be loaded, as you expect tests to produce the same results for everyone. This way every test execution will use the same env defaults across different executions by ignoring your .env.local (which is intended to override the default set).\n\nGood to know: similar to Default Environment Variables, .env.test file should be included in your repository, but .env.test.local shouldn't, as .env*.local are intended to be ignored through .gitignore.\n\nWhile running unit tests you can make sure to load your environment variables the same way Next.js does by leveraging the loadEnvConfig function from the @next/env package.\n// The below can be used in a Jest global setup file or similar for your testing set-up\nimport { loadEnvConfig } from '@next/env'\n \nexport default async () => {\n  const projectDir = process.cwd()\n  loadEnvConfig(projectDir)\n}\nEnvironment Variable Load Order\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nEnvironment variables are looked up in the following places, in order, stopping once the variable is found.\n\nprocess.env\n.env.$(NODE_ENV).local\n.env.local (Not checked when NODE_ENV is test.)\n.env.$(NODE_ENV)\n.env\n\nFor example, if NODE_ENV is development and you define a variable in both .env.development.local and .env, the value in .env.development.local will be used.\n\nGood to know: The allowed values for NODE_ENV are production, development and test.\n\nGood to know\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nIf you are using a /src directory, .env.* files should remain in the root of your project.\nIf the environment variable NODE_ENV is unassigned, Next.js automatically assigns development when running the next dev command, or production for all other commands.\n\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv9.4.0Support .env and NEXT_PUBLIC_ introduced."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_configuring_error-handling.txt","text":"Error HandlingThis documentation explains how you can handle development, server-side, and client-side errors.\nHandling Errors in Development\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen there is a runtime error during the development phase of your Next.js application, you will encounter an overlay. It is a modal that covers the webpage. It is only visible when the development server runs using next dev via pnpm dev, npm run dev, yarn dev, or bun dev and will not be shown in production. Fixing the error will automatically dismiss the overlay.\nHere is an example of an overlay:\n\n\nHandling Server Errors\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js provides a static 500 page by default to handle server-side errors that occur in your application. You can also customize this page by creating a pages/500.js file.\nHaving a 500 page in your application does not show specific errors to the app user.\nYou can also use 404 page to handle specific runtime error like file not found.\nHandling Client Errors\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nReact Error Boundaries is a graceful way to handle a JavaScript error on the client so that the other parts of the application continue working. In addition to preventing the page from crashing, it allows you to provide a custom fallback component and even log error information.\nTo use Error Boundaries for your Next.js application, you must create a class component ErrorBoundary and wrap the Component prop in the pages/_app.js file. This component will be responsible to:\n\nRender a fallback UI after an error is thrown\nProvide a way to reset the Application's state\nLog error information\n\nYou can create an ErrorBoundary class component by extending React.Component. For example:\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n \n    // Define a state variable to track whether is an error or not\n    this.state = { hasError: false }\n  }\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\n    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI\n \n    return { hasError: true }\n  }\n  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {\n    // You can use your own error logging service here\n    console.log({ error, errorInfo })\n  }\n  render() {\n    // Check if the error is thrown\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      // You can render any custom fallback UI\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h2>Oops, there is an error!</h2>\n          <button\n            type=\"button\"\n            onClick={() => this.setState({ hasError: false })}\n          >\n            Try again?\n          </button>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n \n    // Return children components in case of no error\n \n    return this.props.children\n  }\n}\n \nexport default ErrorBoundary\nThe ErrorBoundary component keeps track of an hasError state. The value of this state variable is a boolean. When the value of hasError is true, then the ErrorBoundary component will render a fallback UI. Otherwise, it will render the children components.\nAfter creating an ErrorBoundary component, import it in the pages/_app.js file to wrap the Component prop in your Next.js application.\n// Import the ErrorBoundary component\nimport ErrorBoundary from '../components/ErrorBoundary'\n \nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    // Wrap the Component prop with ErrorBoundary component\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default MyApp\nYou can learn more about Error Boundaries in React's documentation.\nReporting Errors\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo monitor client errors, use a service like Sentry, Bugsnag or Datadog."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_configuring_eslint.txt","text":"ESLint\nNext.js provides an integrated ESLint experience out of the box.

If you include any ESLint rules that depend on more than the contents of a single source file and need to disable the cache, use the --no-cache flag with next lint.\nTerminalnext lint --no-cache\nDisabling Rules\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you would like to modify or disable any rules provided by the supported plugins (react, react-hooks, next), you can directly change them using the rules property in your .eslintrc:\n.eslintrc.json{\n  \"extends\": \"next\",\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"react/no-unescaped-entities\": \"off\",\n    \"@next/next/no-page-custom-font\": \"off\"\n  }\n}\nCore Web Vitals\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe next/core-web-vitals rule set is enabled when next lint is run for the first time and the strict option is selected.\n.eslintrc.json{\n  \"extends\": \"next/core-web-vitals\"\n}\nnext/core-web-vitals updates eslint-plugin-next to error on a number of rules that are warnings by default if they affect Core Web Vitals.\n\nThe next/core-web-vitals entry point is automatically included for new applications built with Create Next App.\n\nUsage With Other Tools\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPrettier\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nESLint also contains code formatting rules, which can conflict with your existing Prettier setup. We recommend including eslint-config-prettier in your ESLint config to make ESLint and Prettier work together.\nFirst, install the dependency:\nTerminalnpm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier\n \nyarn add --dev eslint-config-prettier\n \npnpm add --save-dev eslint-config-prettier\n \nbun add --dev eslint-config-prettier\nThen, add prettier to your existing ESLint config:\n.eslintrc.json{\n  \"extends\": [\"next\", \"prettier\"]\n}\nlint-staged\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you would like to use next lint with lint-staged to run the linter on staged git files, you'll have to add the following to the .lintstagedrc.js file in the root of your project in order to specify usage of the --file flag.\n.lintstagedrc.jsconst path = require('path')\n \nconst buildEslintCommand = (filenames) =>\n  `next lint --fix --file ${filenames\n    .map((f) => path.relative(process.cwd(), f))\n    .join(' --file ')}`\n \nmodule.exports = {\n  '*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}': [buildEslintCommand],\n}\nMigrating Existing Config\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nRecommended Plugin Ruleset\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you already have ESLint configured in your application and any of the following conditions are true:\n\nYou have one or more of the following plugins already installed (either separately or through a different config such as airbnb or react-app):\n\nreact\nreact-hooks\njsx-a11y\nimport\n\n\nYou've defined specific parserOptions that are different from how Babel is configured within Next.js (this is not recommended unless you have customized your Babel configuration)\nYou have eslint-plugin-import installed with Node.js and/or TypeScript resolvers defined to handle imports\n\nThen we recommend either removing these settings if you prefer how these properties have been configured within eslint-config-next or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin instead:\nmodule.exports = {\n  extends: [\n    //...\n    'plugin:@next/next/recommended',\n  ],\n}\nThe plugin can be installed normally in your project without needing to run next lint:\nTerminalnpm install --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n \nyarn add --dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n \npnpm add --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n \nbun add --dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\nThis eliminates the risk of collisions or errors that can occur due to importing the same plugin or parser across multiple configurations.\nAdditional Configurations\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you already use a separate ESLint configuration and want to include eslint-config-next, ensure that it is extended last after other configurations. For example:\n.eslintrc.json{\n  \"extends\": [\"eslint:recommended\", \"next\"]\n}\nThe next configuration already handles setting default values for the parser, plugins and settings properties. There is no need to manually re-declare any of these properties unless you need a different configuration for your use case.\nIf you include any other shareable configurations, you will need to make sure that these properties are not overwritten or modified. Otherwise, we recommend removing any configurations that share behavior with the next configuration or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin as mentioned above."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_configuring_mdx.txt","text":"Markdown and MDX\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It allows you to write using plain text syntax and convert it to structurally valid HTML. It's commonly used for writing content on websites and blogs.\nYou write...\nI **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\nOutput:\n<p>I <strong>love</strong> using <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a></p>\nMDX is a superset of markdown that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity and embed React components within your content.\nNext.js can support both local MDX content inside your application, as well as remote MDX files fetched dynamically on the server. The Next.js plugin handles transforming markdown and React components into HTML, including support for usage in Server Components (the default in App Router).\n@next/mdx\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe @next/mdx package is used to configure Next.js so it can process markdown and MDX. It sources data from local files, allowing you to create pages with a .mdx extension, directly in your /pages or /app directory.\nLet's walk through how to configure and use MDX with Next.js.\nGetting Started\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nInstall packages needed to render MDX:\nTerminalnpm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx\n\nUpdate the next.config.js file at your project's root to configure it to use MDX:\nnext.config.jsconst withMDX = require('@next/mdx')()\n \n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Configure `pageExtensions` to include MDX files\n  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],\n  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below\n}\n \nmodule.exports = withMDX(nextConfig)\n\nThen, create a new MDX page within the /pages directory:  your-project\n  ├── pages\n  │   └── my-mdx-page.mdx\n  └── package.json\nNow you can use markdown and import React components directly inside your MDX page:\nimport { MyComponent } from 'my-components'\n \n# Welcome to my MDX page!\n \nThis is some **bold** and _italics_ text.\n \nThis is a list in markdown:\n \n- One\n- Two\n- Three\n \nCheckout my React component:\n \n<MyComponent />\nNavigating to the /my-mdx-page route should display your rendered MDX.\nRemote MDX\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf your markdown or MDX files or content lives somewhere else, you can fetch it dynamically on the server. This is useful for content stored in a separate local folder, CMS, database, or anywhere else. A popular community package for this use is next-mdx-remote.\n\nGood to know: Please proceed with caution. MDX compiles to JavaScript and is executed on the server. You should only fetch MDX content from a trusted source, otherwise this can lead to remote code execution (RCE).\n\nThe following example uses next-mdx-remote:\n\npages/my-mdx-page-remote.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote, MDXRemoteSerializeResult } from 'next-mdx-remote'\n \ninterface Props {\n  mdxSource: MDXRemoteSerializeResult\n}\n \nexport default function RemoteMdxPage({ mdxSource }: Props) {\n  return <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} />\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, CMS, fetch, anywhere...\n  const res = await fetch('https:...')\n  const mdxText = await res.text()\n  const mdxSource = await serialize(mdxText)\n  return { props: { mdxSource } }\n}\nNavigating to the /my-mdx-page-remote route should display your rendered MDX.\nLayouts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nTo share a layout around MDX pages, create a layout component:components/mdx-layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function MdxLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return <div style={{ color: 'blue' }}>{children}</div>\n}Then, import the layout component into the MDX page, wrap the MDX content in the layout, and export it:import MdxLayout from '../components/mdx-layout'\n \n# Welcome to my MDX page!\n \nexport default function MDXPage({ children }) {\n  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>\n \n}\nRemark and Rehype Plugins\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can optionally provide remark and rehype plugins to transform the MDX content.\nFor example, you can use remark-gfm to support GitHub Flavored Markdown.\nSince the remark and rehype ecosystem is ESM only, you'll need to use next.config.mjs as the configuration file.\nnext.config.mjsimport remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'\nimport createMDX from '@next/mdx'\n \n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Configure `pageExtensions`` to include MDX files\n  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],\n  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below\n}\n \nconst withMDX = createMDX({\n  // Add markdown plugins here, as desired\n  options: {\n    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],\n    rehypePlugins: [],\n  },\n})\n \n// Wrap MDX and Next.js config with each other\nexport default withMDX(nextConfig)\nFrontmatter\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFrontmatter is a YAML like key/value pairing that can be used to store data about a page. @next/mdx does not support frontmatter by default, though there are many solutions for adding frontmatter to your MDX content, such as:\n\nremark-frontmatter\nremark-mdx-frontmatter\ngray-matter.\n\nTo access page metadata with @next/mdx, you can export a metadata object from within the .mdx file:\nexport const metadata = {\n  author: 'John Doe',\n}\n \n# My MDX page\nCustom Elements\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOne of the pleasant aspects of using markdown, is that it maps to native HTML elements, making writing fast, and intuitive:\nThis is a list in markdown:\n \n- One\n- Two\n- Three\nThe above generates the following HTML:\n<p>This is a list in markdown:</p>\n \n<ul>\n  <li>One</li>\n  <li>Two</li>\n  <li>Three</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you want to style your own elements for a custom feel to your website or application, you can pass in shortcodes. These are your own custom components that map to HTML elements.\n\nTo do this, create a mdx-components.tsx file at the root of your application (the parent folder of pages/ or src/) and add custom elements:\nmdx-components.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'\nimport Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \n// This file allows you to provide custom React components\n// to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any\n// React component you want, including inline styles,\n// components from other libraries, and more.\n \nexport function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {\n  return {\n    // Allows customizing built-in components, e.g. to add styling.\n    h1: ({ children }) => <h1 style={{ fontSize: '100px' }}>{children}</h1>,\n    img: (props) => (\n      <Image\n        sizes=\"100vw\"\n        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}\n        {...(props as ImageProps)}\n      />\n    ),\n    ...components,\n  }\n}\n\nDeep Dive: How do you transform markdown into HTML?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nReact does not natively understand markdown. The markdown plaintext needs to first be transformed into HTML. This can be accomplished with remark and rehype.\nremark is an ecosystem of tools around markdown. rehype is the same, but for HTML. For example, the following code snippet transforms markdown into HTML:\nimport { unified } from 'unified'\nimport remarkParse from 'remark-parse'\nimport remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'\nimport rehypeSanitize from 'rehype-sanitize'\nimport rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'\n \nmain()\n \nasync function main() {\n  const file = await unified()\n    .use(remarkParse) // Convert into markdown AST\n    .use(remarkRehype) // Transform to HTML AST\n    .use(rehypeSanitize) // Sanitize HTML input\n    .use(rehypeStringify) // Convert AST into serialized HTML\n    .process('Hello, Next.js!')\n \n  console.log(String(file)) // <p>Hello, Next.js!</p>\n}\nThe remark and rehype ecosystem contains plugins for syntax highlighting, linking headings, generating a table of contents, and more.\nWhen using @next/mdx as shown above, you do not need to use remark or rehype directly, as it is handled for you. We're describing it here for a deeper understanding of what the @next/mdx package is doing underneath.\nUsing the Rust-based MDX compiler (Experimental)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js supports a new MDX compiler written in Rust.

However, it’s not ideal when you’re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to preview the draft immediately on your page. You’d want Next.js to render these pages at request time instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You’d want Next.js to bypass Static Generation only for this specific case.\nNext.js has a feature called Preview Mode which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.\nStep 1: Create and access a preview API route\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nTake a look at the API Routes documentation first if you’re not familiar with Next.js API Routes.\n\nFirst, create a preview API route. It can have any name - e.g. pages/api/preview.js (or .ts if using TypeScript).\nIn this API route, you need to call setPreviewData on the response object. The argument for setPreviewData should be an object, and this can be used by getStaticProps (more on this later). For now, we’ll use {}.\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  // ...\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n  // ...\n}\nres.setPreviewData sets some cookies on the browser which turns on the preview mode. Any requests to Next.js containing these cookies will be considered as the preview mode, and the behavior for statically generated pages will change (more on this later).\nYou can test this manually by creating an API route like below and accessing it from your browser manually:\npages/api/preview.js// simple example for testing it manually from your browser.\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n  res.end('Preview mode enabled')\n}\nIf you open your browser’s developer tools and visit /api/preview, you’ll notice that the __prerender_bypass and __next_preview_data cookies will be set on this request.\nSecurely accessing it from your Headless CMS\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn practice, you’d want to call this API route securely from your headless CMS. The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take.\nThese steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting custom preview URLs. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your preview URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the preview URL manually.\nFirst, you should create a secret token string using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing preview URLs.\nSecond, if your headless CMS supports setting custom preview URLs, specify the following as the preview URL. This assumes that your preview API route is located at pages/api/preview.js.\nTerminalhttps://<your-site>/api/preview?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n\n<your-site> should be your deployment domain.\n<token> should be replaced with the secret token you generated.\n<path> should be the path for the page that you want to preview. If you want to preview /posts/foo, then you should use &slug=/posts/foo.\n\nYour headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the preview URL so that <path> can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: &slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}\nFinally, in the preview API route:\n\nCheck that the secret matches and that the slug parameter exists (if not, the request should fail).\n\nCall res.setPreviewData.\nThen redirect the browser to the path specified by slug. (The following example uses a 307 redirect).\n\nexport default async (req, res) => {\n  // Check the secret and next parameters\n  // This secret should only be known to this API route and the CMS\n  if (req.query.secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !req.query.slug) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' })\n  }\n \n  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists\n  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS\n  const post = await getPostBySlug(req.query.slug)\n \n  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent preview mode from being enabled\n  if (!post) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid slug' })\n  }\n \n  // Enable Preview Mode by setting the cookies\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n \n  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post\n  // We don't redirect to req.query.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities\n  res.redirect(post.slug)\n}\nIf it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to preview with the preview mode cookies being set.\nStep 2: Update getStaticProps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe next step is to update getStaticProps to support the preview mode.\nIf you request a page which has getStaticProps with the preview mode cookies set (via res.setPreviewData), then getStaticProps will be called at request time (instead of at build time).\nFurthermore, it will be called with a context object where:\n\ncontext.preview will be true.\ncontext.previewData will be the same as the argument used for setPreviewData.\n\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  // If you request this page with the preview mode cookies set:\n  //\n  // - context.preview will be true\n  // - context.previewData will be the same as\n  //   the argument used for `setPreviewData`.\n}\nWe used res.setPreviewData({}) in the preview API route, so context.previewData will be {}. You can use this to pass session information from the preview API route to getStaticProps if necessary.\nIf you’re also using getStaticPaths, then context.params will also be available.\nFetch preview data\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can update getStaticProps to fetch different data based on context.preview and/or context.previewData.\nFor example, your headless CMS might have a different API endpoint for draft posts. If so, you can use context.preview to modify the API endpoint URL like below:\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  // If context.preview is true, append \"/preview\" to the API endpoint\n  // to request draft data instead of published data. This will vary\n  // based on which headless CMS you're using.\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../${context.preview ? 'preview' : ''}`)\n  // ...\n}\nThat’s it! If you access the preview API route (with secret and slug) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the preview content. And if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to preview the draft.\nSet this as the preview URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the preview.\nTerminalhttps://<your-site>/api/preview?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\nMore Details\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nGood to know: during rendering next/router exposes an isPreview flag, see the router object docs for more info.\n\nSpecify the Preview Mode duration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nsetPreviewData takes an optional second parameter which should be an options object. It accepts the following keys:\n\nmaxAge: Specifies the number (in seconds) for the preview session to last for.\npath: Specifies the path the cookie should be applied under. Defaults to / enabling preview mode for all paths.\n\nsetPreviewData(data, {\n  maxAge: 60 * 60, // The preview mode cookies expire in 1 hour\n  path: '/about', // The preview mode cookies apply to paths with /about\n})\nClear the Preview Mode cookies\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, no expiration date is set for Preview Mode cookies, so the preview session ends when the browser is closed.\nTo clear the Preview Mode cookies manually, create an API route that calls clearPreviewData():\npages/api/clear-preview-mode-cookies.jsexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.clearPreviewData({})\n}\nThen, send a request to /api/clear-preview-mode-cookies to invoke the API Route. If calling this route using next/link, you must pass prefetch={false} to prevent calling clearPreviewData during link prefetching.\nIf a path was specified in the setPreviewData call, you must pass the same path to clearPreviewData:\npages/api/clear-preview-mode-cookies.jsexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const { path } = req.query\n \n  res.clearPreviewData({ path })\n}\npreviewData size limits\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can pass an object to setPreviewData and have it be available in getStaticProps. However, because the data will be stored in a cookie, there’s a size limitation. Currently, preview data is limited to 2KB.\nWorks with getServerSideProps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe preview mode works on getServerSideProps as well. It will also be available on the context object containing preview and previewData.\n\nGood to know: You shouldn't set the Cache-Control header when using Preview Mode because it cannot be bypassed. Instead, we recommend using ISR.\n\nWorks with API Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAPI Routes will have access to preview and previewData under the request object. For example:\nexport default function myApiRoute(req, res) {\n  const isPreview = req.preview\n  const previewData = req.previewData\n  // ...\n}\nUnique per next build\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBoth the bypass cookie value and the private key for encrypting the previewData change when next build is completed.\nThis ensures that the bypass cookie can’t be guessed.\n\nGood to know: To test Preview Mode locally over HTTP your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_configuring_src-directory.txt","text":"src Directory\nAs an alternative to having the special Next.js app or pages directories in the root of your project, Next.js also supports the common pattern of placing application code under the src directory.\nThis separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project, which is preferred by some individuals and teams.\nTo use the src directory, move the app Router folder or pages Router folder to src/app or src/pages respectively.\n\n\nGood to know\n\nThe /public directory should remain in the root of your project.\nConfig files like package.json, next.config.js and tsconfig.json should remain in the root of your project.\n.env.* files should remain in the root of your project.\nsrc/app or src/pages will be ignored if app or pages are present in the root directory.\nIf you're using src, you'll probably also move other application folders such as /components or /lib.\nIf you're using Middleware, ensure it is placed inside the src directory.\nIf you're using Tailwind CSS, you'll need to add the /src prefix to the tailwind.config.js file in the content section.\nIf you are using TypeScript paths for imports such as @/*, you should update the paths object in tsconfig.json to include src/.\n\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_configuring_typescript.txt","text":"TypeScript\nNext.js provides a TypeScript-first development experience for building your React application.\nIt comes with built-in TypeScript support for automatically installing the necessary packages and configuring the proper settings.\n\nNew Projects\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\ncreate-next-app now ships with TypeScript by default.\nTerminalnpx create-next-app@latest\nExisting Projects\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAdd TypeScript to your project by renaming a file to .ts / .tsx.

Unlike the server-side rendering APIs, you can use client-side data fetching at the component level.\nIf done at the page level, the data is fetched at runtime, and the content of the page is updated as the data changes. When used at the component level, the data is fetched at the time of the component mount, and the content of the component is updated as the data changes.\nIt's important to note that using client-side data fetching can affect the performance of your application and the load speed of your pages. This is because the data fetching is done at the time of the component or pages mount, and the data is not cached.\nClient-side data fetching with useEffect\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following example shows how you can fetch data on the client side using the useEffect hook.\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n \nfunction Profile() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch('/api/profile-data')\n      .then((res) => res.json())\n      .then((data) => {\n        setData(data)\n        setLoading(false)\n      })\n  }, [])\n \n  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>\n  if (!data) return <p>No profile data</p>\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{data.name}</h1>\n      <p>{data.bio}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nClient-side data fetching with SWR\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe team behind Next.js has created a React hook library for data fetching called SWR. It is highly recommended if you are fetching data on the client-side. It handles caching, revalidation, focus tracking, refetching on intervals, and more.\nUsing the same example as above, we can now use SWR to fetch the profile data. SWR will automatically cache the data for us and will revalidate the data if it becomes stale.\nFor more information on using SWR, check out the SWR docs.\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n \nconst fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json())\n \nfunction Profile() {\n  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/profile-data', fetcher)\n \n  if (error) return <div>Failed to load</div>\n  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{data.name}</h1>\n      <p>{data.bio}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_data-fetching_forms-and-mutations.txt","text":"Forms and MutationsForms enable you to create and update data in web applications. Next.js provides a powerful way to handle form submissions and data mutations using API Routes.\n\nGood to know:\n\nWe will soon recommend incrementally adopting the App Router and using Server Actions for handling form submissions and data mutations. Server Actions allow you to define asynchronous server functions that can be called directly from your components, without needing to manually create an API Route.\nAPI Routes do not specify CORS headers, meaning they are same-origin only by default.\nSince API Routes run on the server, we're able to use sensitive values (like API keys) through Environment Variables without exposing them to the client.

This is to allow the page to be hydrated correctly. Make sure that you don't pass any sensitive information that shouldn't be available on the client in props.\nWhen a user visits the page through next/link or next/router, Next.js sends an API request to the server, which runs getServerSideProps.\nYou do not have to call a Next.js API Route to fetch data when using getServerSideProps since the function runs on the server. Instead, you can call a CMS, database, or other third-party APIs directly from inside getServerSideProps.\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nSee getServerSideProps API reference for parameters and props that can be used with getServerSideProps.\nYou can use the next-code-elimination tool to verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle.\n\n\nError Handling\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf an error is thrown inside getServerSideProps, it will show the pages/500.js file. Check out the documentation for 500 page to learn more on how to create it. During development, this file will not be used and the development error overlay will be shown instead.\nEdge Cases\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nEdge Runtime\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\ngetServerSideProps can be used with both Serverless and Edge Runtimes, and you can set props in both.\nHowever, currently in the Edge Runtime, you do not have access to the response object. This means that you cannot — for example — add cookies in getServerSideProps. To have access to the response object, you should continue to use the Node.js runtime, which is the default runtime.\nYou can explicitly set the runtime on a per-page basis by modifying the config, for example:\npages/index.jsexport const config = {\n  runtime: 'nodejs', // or \"edge\"\n}\n \nexport const getServerSideProps = async () => {}\nCaching with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use caching headers (Cache-Control) inside getServerSideProps to cache dynamic responses.

For example, you can have faster builds by generating all pages on-demand for previews (but not production builds). This is helpful for sites with hundreds/thousands of static pages.\npages/posts/[id].jsexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // When this is true (in preview environments) don't\n  // prerender any static pages\n  // (faster builds, but slower initial page load)\n  if (process.env.SKIP_BUILD_STATIC_GENERATION) {\n    return {\n      paths: [],\n      fallback: 'blocking',\n    }\n  }\n \n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // Get the paths we want to prerender based on posts\n  // In production environments, prerender all pages\n  // (slower builds, but faster initial page load)\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n \n  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404\n  return { paths, fallback: false }\n}"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_data-fetching_get-static-props.txt","text":"getStaticPropsIf you export a function called getStaticProps (Static Site Generation) from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by getStaticProps.\npages/index.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { InferGetStaticPropsType, GetStaticProps } from 'next'\n \ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n \nexport const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetStaticProps<{\n  repo: Repo\n}>\n \nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {\n  return repo.stargazers_count\n}\n\n\nNote that irrespective of rendering type, any props will be passed to the page component and can be viewed on the client-side in the initial HTML. This is to allow the page to be hydrated correctly. Make sure that you don't pass any sensitive information that shouldn't be available on the client in props.\n\nThe getStaticProps API reference covers all parameters and props that can be used with getStaticProps.\nWhen should I use getStaticProps?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou should use getStaticProps if:\n\nThe data required to render the page is available at build time ahead of a user’s request\nThe data comes from a headless CMS\nThe page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — getStaticProps generates HTML and JSON files, both of which can be cached by a CDN for performance\nThe data can be publicly cached (not user-specific). This condition can be bypassed in certain specific situation by using a Middleware to rewrite the path.\n\nWhen does getStaticProps run\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\ngetStaticProps always runs on the server and never on the client. You can validate code written inside getStaticProps is removed from the client-side bundle with this tool.\n\ngetStaticProps always runs during next build\ngetStaticProps runs in the background when using fallback: true\ngetStaticProps is called before initial render when using fallback: blocking\ngetStaticProps runs in the background when using revalidate\ngetStaticProps runs on-demand in the background when using revalidate()\n\nWhen combined with Incremental Static Regeneration, getStaticProps will run in the background while the stale page is being revalidated, and the fresh page served to the browser.\ngetStaticProps does not have access to the incoming request (such as query parameters or HTTP headers) as it generates static HTML. If you need access to the request for your page, consider using Middleware in addition to getStaticProps.\nUsing getStaticProps to fetch data from a CMS\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe following example shows how you can fetch a list of blog posts from a CMS.\npages/blog.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()\nexport default function Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li>{post.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do\n// direct database queries.\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.\n  // You can use any data fetching library\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n  }\n}\n\nThe getStaticProps API reference covers all parameters and props that can be used with getStaticProps.\nWrite server-side code directly\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAs getStaticProps runs only on the server-side, it will never run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser, so you can write direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.\nThis means that instead of fetching an API route from getStaticProps (that itself fetches data from an external source), you can write the server-side code directly in getStaticProps.\nTake the following example. An API route is used to fetch some data from a CMS. That API route is then called directly from getStaticProps. This produces an additional call, reducing performance. Instead, the logic for fetching the data from the CMS can be shared by using a lib/ directory. Then it can be shared with getStaticProps.\nlib/load-posts.js// The following function is shared\n// with getStaticProps and API routes\n// from a `lib/` directory\nexport async function loadPosts() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts/')\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  return data\n}\npages/blog.js// pages/blog.js\nimport { loadPosts } from '../lib/load-posts'\n \n// This function runs only on the server side\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // Instead of fetching your `/api` route you can call the same\n  // function directly in `getStaticProps`\n  const posts = await loadPosts()\n \n  // Props returned will be passed to the page component\n  return { props: { posts } }\n}\nAlternatively, if you are not using API routes to fetch data, then the fetch() API can be used directly in getStaticProps to fetch data.\nTo verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle, you can use the next-code-elimination tool.\nStatically generates both HTML and JSON\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen a page with getStaticProps is pre-rendered at build time, in addition to the page HTML file, Next.js generates a JSON file holding the result of running getStaticProps.\nThis JSON file will be used in client-side routing through next/link or next/router. When you navigate to a page that’s pre-rendered using getStaticProps, Next.js fetches this JSON file (pre-computed at build time) and uses it as the props for the page component. This means that client-side page transitions will not call getStaticProps as only the exported JSON is used.\nWhen using Incremental Static Generation, getStaticProps will be executed in the background to generate the JSON needed for client-side navigation. You may see this in the form of multiple requests being made for the same page, however, this is intended and has no impact on end-user performance.\nWhere can I use getStaticProps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\ngetStaticProps can only be exported from a page. You cannot export it from non-page files, _app, _document, or _error.\nOne of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all the required data before the page is rendered.\nAlso, you must use export getStaticProps as a standalone function — it will not work if you add getStaticProps as a property of the page component.\n\nGood to know: if you have created a custom app, ensure you are passing the pageProps to the page component as shown in the linked document, otherwise the props will be empty.\n\nRuns on every request in development\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn development (next dev), getStaticProps will be called on every request.\nPreview Mode\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can temporarily bypass static generation and render the page at request time instead of build time using Preview Mode. For example, you might be using a headless CMS and want to preview drafts before they're published."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_data-fetching_incremental-static-regeneration.txt","text":"Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)Examples\nNext.js Commerce\nGitHub Reactions Demo\nStatic Tweet Demo\n\nNext.js allows you to create or update static pages after you’ve built your site. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) enables you to use static-generation on a per-page basis, without needing to rebuild the entire site. With ISR, you can retain the benefits of static while scaling to millions of pages.\n\nGood to know: The edge runtime is currently not compatible with ISR, although you can leverage stale-while-revalidate by setting the cache-control header manually.\n\nTo use ISR, add the revalidate prop to getStaticProps:\nfunction Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if\n// revalidation is enabled and a new request comes in\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:\n    // - When a request comes in\n    // - At most once every 10 seconds\n    revalidate: 10, // In seconds\n  }\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if\n// the path has not been generated.\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n \n  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.\n  // { fallback: 'blocking' } will server-render pages\n  // on-demand if the path doesn't exist.\n  return { paths, fallback: 'blocking' }\n}\n \nexport default Blog\nWhen a request is made to a page that was pre-rendered at build time, it will initially show the cached page.\n\nAny requests to the page after the initial request and before 10 seconds are also cached and instantaneous.\nAfter the 10-second window, the next request will still show the cached (stale) page\nNext.js triggers a regeneration of the page in the background.\nOnce the page generates successfully, Next.js will invalidate the cache and show the updated page. If the background regeneration fails, the old page would still be unaltered.\n\nWhen a request is made to a path that hasn’t been generated, Next.js will server-render the page on the first request. Future requests will serve the static file from the cache. ISR on Vercel persists the cache globally and handles rollbacks.\n\nGood to know: Check if your upstream data provider has caching enabled by default. You might need to disable (e.g. useCdn: false), otherwise a revalidation won't be able to pull fresh data to update the ISR cache. Caching can occur at a CDN (for an endpoint being requested) when it returns the Cache-Control header.\n\nOn-Demand Revalidation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you set a revalidate time of 60, all visitors will see the same generated version of your site for one minute. The only way to invalidate the cache is from someone visiting that page after the minute has passed.\nStarting with v12.2.0, Next.js supports On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration to manually purge the Next.js cache for a specific page. This makes it easier to update your site when:\n\nContent from your headless CMS is created or updated\nEcommerce metadata changes (price, description, category, reviews, etc.)\n\nInside getStaticProps, you do not need to specify revalidate to use on-demand revalidation. If revalidate is omitted, Next.js will use the default value of false (no revalidation) and only revalidate the page on-demand when revalidate() is called.\n\nGood to know: Middleware won't be executed for On-Demand ISR requests. Instead, call revalidate() on the exact path that you want revalidated. For example, if you have pages/blog/[slug].js and a rewrite from /post-1 -> /blog/post-1, you would need to call res.revalidate('/blog/post-1').\n\nUsing On-Demand Revalidation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFirst, create a secret token only known by your Next.js app. This secret will be used to prevent unauthorized access to the revalidation API Route. You can access the route (either manually or with a webhook) with the following URL structure:\nTerminalhttps://<your-site.com>/api/revalidate?secret=<token>\nNext, add the secret as an Environment Variable to your application. Finally, create the revalidation API Route:\npages/api/revalidate.jsexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  // Check for secret to confirm this is a valid request\n  if (req.query.secret !== process.env.MY_SECRET_TOKEN) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' })\n  }\n \n  try {\n    // this should be the actual path not a rewritten path\n    // e.g. for \"/blog/[slug]\" this should be \"/blog/post-1\"\n    await res.revalidate('/path-to-revalidate')\n    return res.json({ revalidated: true })\n  } catch (err) {\n    // If there was an error, Next.js will continue\n    // to show the last successfully generated page\n    return res.status(500).send('Error revalidating')\n  }\n}\nView our demo to see on-demand revalidation in action and provide feedback.\nTesting on-Demand ISR during development\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen running locally with next dev, getStaticProps is invoked on every request. To verify your on-demand ISR configuration is correct, you will need to create a production build and start the production server:\nTerminal$ next build\n$ next start\nThen, you can confirm that static pages have successfully revalidated.\nError handling and revalidation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf there is an error inside getStaticProps when handling background regeneration, or you manually throw an error, the last successfully generated page will continue to show. On the next subsequent request, Next.js will retry calling getStaticProps.\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // If this request throws an uncaught error, Next.js will\n  // not invalidate the currently shown page and\n  // retry getStaticProps on the next request.\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  if (!res.ok) {\n    // If there is a server error, you might want to\n    // throw an error instead of returning so that the cache is not updated\n    // until the next successful request.\n    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch posts, received status ${res.status}`)\n  }\n \n  // If the request was successful, return the posts\n  // and revalidate every 10 seconds.\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n    revalidate: 10,\n  }\n}\nSelf-hosting ISR\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR) works on self-hosted Next.js sites out of the box when you use next start.\nLearn more about self-hosting Next.js.\nVersion History\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVersionChangesv14.1.0Custom cacheHandler is stable.v12.2.0On-Demand ISR is stablev12.1.0On-Demand ISR added (beta).v12.0.0Bot-aware ISR fallback added.v9.5.0Base Path added."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_deploying.txt","text":"Deploying\nCongratulations, it's time to ship to production.\nYou can deploy managed Next.js with Vercel, or self-host on a Node.js server, Docker image, or even static HTML files. When deploying using next start, all Next.js features are supported.\nProduction Builds\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nRunning next build generates an optimized version of your application for production. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are created based on your pages. JavaScript is compiled and browser bundles are minified using the Next.js Compiler to help achieve the best performance and support all modern browsers.\nNext.js produces a standard deployment output used by managed and self-hosted Next.js. This ensures all features are supported across both methods of deployment. In the next major version, we will be transforming this output into our Build Output API specification.\nManaged Next.js with Vercel\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nVercel, the creators and maintainers of Next.js, provide managed infrastructure and a developer experience platform for your Next.js applications.\nDeploying to Vercel is zero-configuration and provides additional enhancements for scalability, availability, and performance globally. However, all Next.js features are still supported when self-hosted.\nLearn more about Next.js on Vercel or deploy a template for free to try it out.\nSelf-Hosting\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can self-host Next.js in three different ways:\n\nA Node.js server\nA Docker container\nA static export\n\nNode.js Server\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js. Ensure your package.json has the \"build\" and \"start\" scripts:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\nThen, run npm run build to build your application. Finally, run npm run start to start the Node.js server. This server supports all Next.js features.\nDocker Image\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Docker containers. You can use this approach when deploying to container orchestrators such as Kubernetes or when running inside a container in any cloud provider.\n\nInstall Docker on your machine\nClone our example (or the multi-environment example)\nBuild your container: docker build -t nextjs-docker .\nRun your container: docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-docker\n\nNext.js through Docker supports all Next.js features.\nStatic HTML Export\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server.\nSince Next.js supports this static export, it can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets. This includes tools like AWS S3, Nginx, or Apache.\nRunning as a static export does not support Next.js features that require a server. Learn more.\n\nGood to know:\n\nServer Components are supported with static exports.\n\n\nFeatures\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nImage Optimization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nImage Optimization through next/image works self-hosted with zero configuration when deploying using next start. If you would prefer to have a separate service to optimize images, you can configure an image loader.\nImage Optimization can be used with a static export by defining a custom image loader in next.config.js. Note that images are optimized at runtime, not during the build.\n\nGood to know:\n\nWhen self-hosting, consider installing sharp for more performant Image Optimization in your production environment by running npm install sharp in your project directory. On Linux platforms, sharp may require additional configuration to prevent excessive memory usage.\nLearn more about the caching behavior of optimized images and how to configure the TTL.\nYou can also disable Image Optimization and still retain other benefits of using next/image if you prefer. For example, if you are optimizing images yourself separately.\n\n\nMiddleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware works self-hosted with zero configuration when deploying using next start. Since it requires access to the incoming request, it is not supported when using a static export.\nMiddleware uses a runtime that is a subset of all available Node.js APIs to help ensure low latency, since it may run in front of every route or asset in your application. This runtime does not require running “at the edge” and works in a single-region server. Additional configuration and infrastructure are required to run Middleware in multiple regions.\nIf you are looking to add logic (or use an external package) that requires all Node.js APIs, you might be able to move this logic to a layout as a Server Component. For example, checking headers and redirecting. You can also use headers, cookies, or query parameters to redirect or rewrite through next.config.js. If that does not work, you can also use a custom server.\nEnvironment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can support both build time and runtime environment variables.\nBy default, environment variables are only available on the server. To expose an environment variable to the browser, it must be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_. However, these public environment variables will be inlined into the JavaScript bundle during next build.\nTo read runtime environment variables, we recommend using getServerSideProps or incrementally adopting the App Router. With the App Router, we can safely read environment variables on the server during dynamic rendering. This allows you to use a singular Docker image that can be promoted through multiple environments with different values.\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache';\n \nexport default function Component() {\n  noStore();\n  // cookies(), headers(), and other dynamic functions\n  // will also opt into dynamic rendering, making\n  // this env variable is evaluated at runtime\n  const value = process.env.MY_VALUE\n  ...\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nYou can run code on server startup using the register function.\nWe do not recommend using the runtimeConfig option, as this does not work with the standalone output mode. Instead, we recommend incrementally adopting the App Router.\n\n\nCaching and ISR\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js can cache responses, generated static pages, build outputs, and other static assets like images, fonts, and scripts.\nCaching and revalidating pages (using Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) or newer functions in the App Router) use the same shared cache. By default, this cache is stored to the filesystem (on disk) on your Next.js server. This works automatically when self-hosting using both the Pages and App Router.\nYou can configure the Next.js cache location if you want to persist cached pages and data to durable storage, or share the cache across multiple containers or instances of your Next.js application.\nAutomatic Caching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nNext.js sets the Cache-Control header of public, max-age=31536000, immutable to truly immutable assets. It cannot be overridden. These immutable files contain a SHA-hash in the file name, so they can be safely cached indefinitely. For example, Static Image Imports. You can configure the TTL for images.\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR) sets the Cache-Control header of s-maxage: <revalidate in getStaticProps>, stale-while-revalidate. This revalidation time is defined in your getStaticProps function in seconds. If you set revalidate: false, it will default to a one-year cache duration.\nDynamically rendered pages set a Cache-Control header of private, no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate to prevent user-specific data from being cached. This applies to both the App Router and Pages Router. This also includes Draft Mode.\n\nStatic Assets\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you want to host static assets on a different domain or CDN, you can use the assetPrefix configuration in next.config.js. Next.js will use this asset prefix when retrieving JavaScript or CSS files. Separating your assets to a different domain does come with the downside of extra time spent on DNS and TLS resolution.\nLearn more about assetPrefix.\nConfiguring Caching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, generated cache assets will be stored in memory (defaults to 50mb) and on disk. If you are hosting Next.js using a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes, each pod will have a copy of the cache. To prevent stale data from being shown since the cache is not shared between pods by default, you can configure the Next.js cache to provide a cache handler and disable in-memory caching.\nTo configure the ISR/Data Cache location when self-hosting, you can configure a custom handler in your next.config.js file:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  cacheHandler: require.resolve('./cache-handler.js'),\n  cacheMaxMemorySize: 0, // disable default in-memory caching\n}\nThen, create cache-handler.js in the root of your project, for example:\ncache-handler.jsconst cache = new Map()\n \nmodule.exports = class CacheHandler {\n  constructor(options) {\n    this.options = options\n  }\n \n  async get(key) {\n    // This could be stored anywhere, like durable storage\n    return cache.get(key)\n  }\n \n  async set(key, data, ctx) {\n    // This could be stored anywhere, like durable storage\n    cache.set(key, {\n      value: data,\n      lastModified: Date.now(),\n      tags: ctx.tags,\n    })\n  }\n \n  async revalidateTag(tag) {\n    // Iterate over all entries in the cache\n    for (let [key, value] of cache) {\n      // If the value's tags include the specified tag, delete this entry\n      if (value.tags.includes(tag)) {\n        cache.delete(key)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nUsing a custom cache handler will allow you to ensure consistency across all pods hosting your Next.js application. For instance, you can save the cached values anywhere, like Redis or AWS S3.\n\nGood to know:\n\nrevalidatePath is a convenience layer on top of cache tags. Calling revalidatePath will call the revalidateTag function with a special default tag for the provided page.\n\n\nBuild Cache\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js generates an ID during next build to identify which version of your application is being served. The same build should be used and boot up multiple containers.\nIf you are rebuilding for each stage of your environment, you will need to generate a consistent build ID to use between containers. Use the generateBuildId command in next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  generateBuildId: async () => {\n    // This could be anything, using the latest git hash\n    return process.env.GIT_HASH\n  },\n}\nVersion Skew\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js will automatically mitigate most instances of version skew and automatically reload the application to retrieve new assets when detected. For example, if there is a mismatch in the deploymentId, transitions between pages will perform a hard navigation versus using a prefetched value.\nWhen the application is reloaded, there may be a loss of application state if it's not designed to persist between page navigations. For example, using URL state or local storage would persist state after a page refresh.

This means only the code needed for the current page is loaded on navigation. You may also consider lazy loading third-party libraries, where appropriate.\nPrefetching: When a link to a new route enters the user's viewport, Next.js prefetches the route in background. This makes navigation to new routes almost instant. You can opt out of prefetching, where appropriate.\nAutomatic Static Optimization: Next.js automatically determines that a page is static (can be pre-rendered) if it has no blocking data requirements. Optimized pages can be cached, and served to the end-user from multiple CDN locations. You may opt into Server-side Rendering, where appropriate.\n\nThese defaults aim to improve your application's performance, and reduce the cost and amount of data transferred on each network request.\nDuring development\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhile building your application, we recommend using the following features to ensure the best performance and user experience:\nRouting and rendering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n<Link> component: Use the <Link> component for client-side navigation and prefetching.\nCustom Errors: Gracefully handle 500 and 404 errors\n\nData fetching and caching\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nAPI Routes: Use Route Handlers to access your backend resources, and prevent sensitive secrets from being exposed to the client.\nData Caching: Verify whether your data requests are being cached or not, and opt into caching, where appropriate. Ensure requests that don't use getStaticProps are cached where appropriate.\nIncremental Static Regeneration: Use Incremental Static Regeneration to update static pages after they've been built, without rebuilding your entire site.\nStatic Images: Use the public directory to automatically cache your application's static assets, e.g. images.\n\nUI and accessibility\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nFont Module: Optimize fonts by using the Font Module, which automatically hosts your font files with other static assets, removes external network requests, and reduces layout shift.\n<Image> Component: Optimize images by using the Image Component, which automatically optimizes images, prevents layout shift, and serves them in modern formats like WebP or AVIF.\n<Script> Component: Optimize third-party scripts by using the Script Component, which automatically defers scripts and prevents them from blocking the main thread.\nESLint: Use the built-in eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y plugin to catch accessibility issues early.\n\nSecurity\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nEnvironment Variables: Ensure your .env.* files are added to .gitignore and only public variables are prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_.\nContent Security Policy: Consider adding a Content Security Policy to protect your application against various security threats such as cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.\n\nMetadata and SEO\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n<Head> Component: Use the next/head component to add page titles, descriptions, and more.\n\nType safety\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nTypeScript and TS Plugin: Use TypeScript and the TypeScript plugin for better type-safety, and to help you catch errors early.\n\nBefore going to production\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBefore going to production, you can run next build to build your application locally and catch any build errors, then run next start to measure the performance of your application in a production-like environment.\nCore Web Vitals\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nLighthouse: Run lighthouse in incognito to gain a better understanding of how your users will experience your site, and to identify areas for improvement. This is a simulated test and should be paired with looking at field data (such as Core Web Vitals).\n\n\nAnalyzing bundles\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUse the @next/bundle-analyzer plugin to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles and identify large modules and dependencies that might be impacting your application's performance.\nAdditionally, the following tools can you understand the impact of adding new dependencies to your application:\n\nImport Cost\nPackage Phobia\nBundle Phobia\nbundlejs\n\nAfter deployment\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDepending on where you deploy your application, you might have access to additional tools and integrations to help you monitor and improve your application's performance.\nFor Vercel deployments, we recommend the following:\n\nAnalytics: A built-in analytics dashboard to help you understand your application's traffic, including the number of unique visitors, page views, and more.\nSpeed Insights: Real-world performance insights based on visitor data, offering a practical view of how your website is performing in the field.\nLogging: Runtime and Activity logs to help you debug issues and monitor your application in production. Alternatively, see the integrations page for a list of third-party tools and services.\n\n\nGood to know:\nTo get a comprehensive understanding of the best practices for production deployments on Vercel, including detailed strategies for improving website performance, refer to the Vercel Production Checklist.\n\nFollowing these recommendations will help you build a faster, more reliable, and secure application for your users."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_deploying_static-exports.txt","text":"Static Exports\nNext.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server.\nWhen running next build, Next.js generates an HTML file per route.

Roboto Mono should be imported as Roboto_Mono.\n\nApply the font in <head>\n  \n    \n    \n  \nYou can also use the font without a wrapper and className by injecting it inside the <head> as follows:pages/_app.jsimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n \nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <style jsx global>{`\n        html {\n          font-family: ${inter.style.fontFamily};\n        }\n      `}</style>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </>\n  )\n}Single page usage\n  \n    \n    \n  \nTo use the font on a single page, add it to the specific page as shown below:pages/index.jsimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n \nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div className={inter.className}>\n      <p>Hello World</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nSpecifying a subset\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nGoogle Fonts are automatically subset. This reduces the size of the font file and improves performance. You'll need to define which of these subsets you want to preload. Failing to specify any subsets while preload is true will result in a warning.\nThis can be done by adding it to the function call:\n\npages/_app.jsconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\nView the Font API Reference for more information.\nUsing Multiple Fonts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can import and use multiple fonts in your application. There are two approaches you can take.\nThe first approach is to create a utility function that exports a font, imports it, and applies its className where needed. This ensures the font is preloaded only when it's rendered:\napp/fonts.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n \nexport const inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nexport const roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\n\nIn the example above, Inter will be applied globally, and Roboto Mono can be imported and applied as needed.\nAlternatively, you can create a CSS variable and use it with your preferred CSS solution:\n\napp/global.csshtml {\n  font-family: var(--font-inter);\n}\n \nh1 {\n  font-family: var(--font-roboto-mono);\n}\nIn the example above, Inter will be applied globally, and any <h1> tags will be styled with Roboto Mono.\n\nRecommendation: Use multiple fonts conservatively since each new font is an additional resource the client has to download.\n\nLocal Fonts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nImport next/font/local and specify the src of your local font file. We recommend using variable fonts for the best performance and flexibility.\n\npages/_app.jsimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n \n// Font files can be colocated inside of `pages`\nconst myFont = localFont({ src: './my-font.woff2' })\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <main className={myFont.className}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\nIf you want to use multiple files for a single font family, src can be an array:\nconst roboto = localFont({\n  src: [\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Regular.woff2',\n      weight: '400',\n      style: 'normal',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Italic.woff2',\n      weight: '400',\n      style: 'italic',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Bold.woff2',\n      weight: '700',\n      style: 'normal',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-BoldItalic.woff2',\n      weight: '700',\n      style: 'italic',\n    },\n  ],\n})\nView the Font API Reference for more information.\nWith Tailwind CSS\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nnext/font can be used with Tailwind CSS through a CSS variable.\nIn the example below, we use the font Inter from next/font/google (you can use any font from Google or Local Fonts). Load your font with the variable option to define your CSS variable name and assign it to inter. Then, use inter.variable to add the CSS variable to your HTML document.\n\npages/_app.jsimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n \nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <main className={`${inter.variable} font-sans`}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\nFinally, add the CSS variable to your Tailwind CSS config:\ntailwind.config.js/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontFamily: {\n        sans: ['var(--font-inter)'],\n        mono: ['var(--font-roboto-mono)'],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\nYou can now use the font-sans and font-mono utility classes to apply the font to your elements.\nPreloading\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nWhen a font function is called on a page of your site, it is not globally available and preloaded on all routes. Rather, the font is only preloaded on the related route/s based on the type of file where it is used:\nif it's a unique page, it is preloaded on the unique route for that page\nif it's in the custom App, it is preloaded on all the routes of the site under /pages\n\nReusing fonts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nEvery time you call the localFont or Google font function, that font is hosted as one instance in your application. Therefore, if you load the same font function in multiple files, multiple instances of the same font are hosted. In this situation, it is recommended to do the following:\n\nCall the font loader function in one shared file\nExport it as a constant\nImport the constant in each file where you would like to use this font\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_optimizing_images.txt","text":"Image Optimization\nExamples\nImage Component\n\nAccording to Web Almanac, images account for a huge portion of the typical website’s page weight and can have a sizable impact on your website's LCP performance.\nThe Next.js Image component extends the HTML <img> element with features for automatic image optimization:\n\nSize Optimization: Automatically serve correctly sized images for each device, using modern image formats like WebP and AVIF.\nVisual Stability: Prevent layout shift automatically when images are loading.\nFaster Page Loads: Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport using native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.\nAsset Flexibility: On-demand image resizing, even for images stored on remote servers\n\n\n🎥 Watch: Learn more about how to use next/image → YouTube (9 minutes).\n\nUsage\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nYou can then define the src for your image (either local or remote).\nLocal Images\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo use a local image, import your .jpg, .png, or .webp image files.\nNext.js will automatically determine the width and height of your image based on the imported file. These values are used to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift while your image is loading.\n\npages/index.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport profilePic from '../public/me.png'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={profilePic}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      // width={500} automatically provided\n      // height={500} automatically provided\n      // blurDataURL=\"data:...\" automatically provided\n      // placeholder=\"blur\" // Optional blur-up while loading\n    />\n  )\n}\n\nWarning: Dynamic await import() or require() are not supported. The import must be static so it can be analyzed at build time.\n\nRemote Images\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo use a remote image, the src property should be a URL string.\nSince Next.js does not have access to remote files during the build process, you'll need to provide the width, height and optional blurDataURL props manually.\nThe width and height attributes are used to infer the correct aspect ratio of image and avoid layout shift from the image loading in. The width and height do not determine the rendered size of the image file. Learn more about Image Sizing.\napp/page.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\nTo safely allow optimizing images, define a list of supported URL patterns in next.config.js. Be as specific as possible to prevent malicious usage. For example, the following configuration will only allow images from a specific AWS S3 bucket:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 's3.amazonaws.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/my-bucket/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\nLearn more about remotePatterns configuration. If you want to use relative URLs for the image src, use a loader.\nDomains\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSometimes you may want to optimize a remote image, but still use the built-in Next.js Image Optimization API. To do this, leave the loader at its default setting and enter an absolute URL for the Image src prop.\nTo protect your application from malicious users, you must define a list of remote hostnames you intend to use with the next/image component.\n\nLearn more about remotePatterns configuration.\n\nLoaders\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNote that in the example earlier, a partial URL (\"/me.png\") is provided for a local image. This is possible because of the loader architecture.\nA loader is a function that generates the URLs for your image. It modifies the provided src, and generates multiple URLs to request the image at different sizes. These multiple URLs are used in the automatic srcset generation, so that visitors to your site will be served an image that is the right size for their viewport.\nThe default loader for Next.js applications uses the built-in Image Optimization API, which optimizes images from anywhere on the web, and then serves them directly from the Next.js web server. If you would like to serve your images directly from a CDN or image server, you can write your own loader function with a few lines of JavaScript.\nYou can define a loader per-image with the loader prop, or at the application level with the loaderFile configuration.\nPriority\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou should add the priority property to the image that will be the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element for each page. Doing so allows Next.js to specially prioritize the image for loading (e.g. through preload tags or priority hints), leading to a meaningful boost in LCP.\nThe LCP element is typically the largest image or text block visible within the viewport of the page. When you run next dev, you'll see a console warning if the LCP element is an <Image> without the priority property.\nOnce you've identified the LCP image, you can add the property like this:\napp/page.jsimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>My Homepage</h1>\n      <Image\n        src=\"/me.png\"\n        alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n        width={500}\n        height={500}\n        priority\n      />\n      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nSee more about priority in the next/image component documentation.\nImage Sizing\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOne of the ways that images most commonly hurt performance is through layout shift, where the image pushes other elements around on the page as it loads in. This performance problem is so annoying to users that it has its own Core Web Vital, called Cumulative Layout Shift. The way to avoid image-based layout shifts is to always size your images. This allows the browser to reserve precisely enough space for the image before it loads.\nBecause next/image is designed to guarantee good performance results, it cannot be used in a way that will contribute to layout shift, and must be sized in one of three ways:\n\nAutomatically, using a static import\nExplicitly, by including a width and height property\nImplicitly, by using fill which causes the image to expand to fill its parent element.\n\n\nWhat if I don't know the size of my images?\nIf you are accessing images from a source without knowledge of the images' sizes, there are several things you can do:\nUse fill\nThe fill prop allows your image to be sized by its parent element. Consider using CSS to give the image's parent element space on the page along sizes prop to match any media query break points. You can also use object-fit with fill, contain, or cover, and object-position to define how the image should occupy that space.\nNormalize your images\nIf you're serving images from a source that you control, consider modifying your image pipeline to normalize the images to a specific size.\nModify your API calls\nIf your application is retrieving image URLs using an API call (such as to a CMS), you may be able to modify the API call to return the image dimensions along with the URL.\n\nIf none of the suggested methods works for sizing your images, the next/image component is designed to work well on a page alongside standard <img> elements.\nStyling\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nStyling the Image component is similar to styling a normal <img> element, but there are a few guidelines to keep in mind:\n\nUse className or style, not styled-jsx.\n\nIn most cases, we recommend using the className prop. This can be an imported CSS Module, a global stylesheet, etc.\nYou can also use the style prop to assign inline styles.\nYou cannot use styled-jsx because it's scoped to the current component (unless you mark the style as global).\n\n\nWhen using fill, the parent element must have position: relative\n\nThis is necessary for the proper rendering of the image element in that layout mode.\n\n\nWhen using fill, the parent element must have display: block\n\nThis is the default for <div> elements but should be specified otherwise.\n\n\n\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nResponsive\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Responsive() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n      <Image\n        alt=\"Mountains\"\n        // Importing an image will\n        // automatically set the width and height\n        src={mountains}\n        sizes=\"100vw\"\n        // Make the image display full width\n        style={{\n          width: '100%',\n          height: 'auto',\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nFill Container\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Fill() {\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{\n        display: 'grid',\n        gridGap: '8px',\n        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, auto))',\n      }}\n    >\n      <div style={{ position: 'relative', height: '400px' }}>\n        <Image\n          alt=\"Mountains\"\n          src={mountains}\n          fill\n          sizes=\"(min-width: 808px) 50vw, 100vw\"\n          style={{\n            objectFit: 'cover', // cover, contain, none\n          }}\n        />\n      </div>\n      {/* And more images in the grid... */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nBackground Image\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Background() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      alt=\"Mountains\"\n      src={mountains}\n      placeholder=\"blur\"\n      quality={100}\n      fill\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        objectFit: 'cover',\n      }}\n    />\n  )\n}\nFor examples of the Image component used with the various styles, see the Image Component Demo.\nOther Properties\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nView all properties available to the next/image component.\nConfiguration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe next/image component and Next.js Image Optimization API can be configured in the next.config.js file.

For example, you might import a file that defines a set of global variables, but never explicitly use the imported file in your code. You would still have access to the global variables the package has declared.\nWe recommend importing files using JavaScript import syntax within your register function. The following example demonstrates a basic usage of import in a register function:\ninstrumentation.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport async function register() {\n  await import('package-with-side-effect')\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\nWe recommend importing the file from within the register function, rather than at the top of the file.

Lazy loading applies to Client Components.\nnext/dynamic\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nnext/dynamic is a composite of React.lazy() and Suspense. It behaves the same way in the app and pages directories to allow for incremental migration.\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nBy using next/dynamic, the header component will not be included in the page's initial JavaScript bundle. The page will render the Suspense fallback first, followed by the Header component when the Suspense boundary is resolved.import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst DynamicHeader = dynamic(() => import('../components/header'), {\n  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,\n})\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return <DynamicHeader />\n}\nGood to know: In import('path/to/component'), the path must be explicitly written. It can't be a template string nor a variable. Furthermore the import() has to be inside the dynamic() call for Next.js to be able to match webpack bundles / module ids to the specific dynamic() call and preload them before rendering. dynamic() can't be used inside of React rendering as it needs to be marked in the top level of the module for preloading to work, similar to React.lazy.\nWith named exports\n  \n    \n    \n  \nTo dynamically import a named export, you can return it from the Promise returned by import():components/hello.jsexport function Hello() {\n  return <p>Hello!</p>\n}\n \n// pages/index.js\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst DynamicComponent = dynamic(() =>\n  import('../components/hello').then((mod) => mod.Hello)\n)With no SSR\n  \n    \n    \n  \nTo dynamically load a component on the client side, you can use the ssr option to disable server-rendering.

By leveraging observability tools, such as logging and metrics, developers can gain insights into their application's behavior and identify areas for optimization. With observability, developers can proactively address issues before they become major problems and provide a better user experience. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use observability in your Next.js applications to improve performance, optimize resources, and enhance user experience.\nWe recommend using OpenTelemetry for instrumenting your apps.\nIt's a platform-agnostic way to instrument apps that allows you to change your observability provider without changing your code.\nRead Official OpenTelemetry docs for more information about OpenTelemetry and how it works.\nThis documentation uses terms like Span, Trace or Exporter throughout this doc, all of which can be found in the OpenTelemetry Observability Primer.\nNext.js supports OpenTelemetry instrumentation out of the box, which means that we already instrumented Next.js itself.\nWhen you enable OpenTelemetry we will automatically wrap all your code like getStaticProps in spans with helpful attributes.\nGetting Started\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOpenTelemetry is extensible but setting it up properly can be quite verbose.\nThat's why we prepared a package @vercel/otel that helps you get started quickly.\nUsing @vercel/otel\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo get started, you must install @vercel/otel:\nTerminalnpm install @vercel/otel\n\nNext, create a custom instrumentation.ts (or .js) file in the root directory of the project (or inside src folder if using one):\nyour-project/instrumentation.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'\n \nexport function register() {\n  registerOTel({ serviceName: 'next-app' })\n}\n\nSee the @vercel/otel documentation for additional configuration options.\n\n\nGood to know\n\nThe instrumentation file should be in the root of your project and not inside the app or pages directory.

But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can configure OpenTelemetry manually.\nFirstly you need to install OpenTelemetry packages:\nTerminalnpm install @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http\nNow you can initialize NodeSDK in your instrumentation.ts.\nUnlike @vercel/otel, NodeSDK is not compatible with edge runtime, so you need to make sure that you are importing them only when process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs'. We recommend creating a new file instrumentation.node.ts which you conditionally import only when using node:\ninstrumentation.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport async function register() {\n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {\n    await import('./instrumentation.node.ts')\n  }\n}\n\ninstrumentation.node.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node'\nimport { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http'\nimport { Resource } from '@opentelemetry/resources'\nimport { SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME } from '@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions'\nimport { SimpleSpanProcessor } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node'\n \nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\n  resource: new Resource({\n    [SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME]: 'next-app',\n  }),\n  spanProcessor: new SimpleSpanProcessor(new OTLPTraceExporter()),\n})\nsdk.start()\n\nDoing this is equivalent to using @vercel/otel, but it's possible to modify and extend some features that are not exposed by the @vercel/otel. If edge runtime support is necessary, you will have to use @vercel/otel.\nTesting your instrumentation\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou need an OpenTelemetry collector with a compatible backend to test OpenTelemetry traces locally.\nWe recommend using our OpenTelemetry dev environment.\nIf everything works well you should be able to see the root server span labeled as GET /requested/pathname.\nAll other spans from that particular trace will be nested under it.\nNext.js traces more spans than are emitted by default.\nTo see more spans, you must set NEXT_OTEL_VERBOSE=1.\nDeployment\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUsing OpenTelemetry Collector\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen you are deploying with OpenTelemetry Collector, you can use @vercel/otel.\nIt will work both on Vercel and when self-hosted.\nDeploying on Vercel\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWe made sure that OpenTelemetry works out of the box on Vercel.\nFollow Vercel documentation to connect your project to an observability provider.\nSelf-hosting\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDeploying to other platforms is also straightforward. You will need to spin up your own OpenTelemetry Collector to receive and process the telemetry data from your Next.js app.\nTo do this, follow the OpenTelemetry Collector Getting Started guide, which will walk you through setting up the collector and configuring it to receive data from your Next.js app.\nOnce you have your collector up and running, you can deploy your Next.js app to your chosen platform following their respective deployment guides.\nCustom Exporters\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOpenTelemetry Collector is not necessary. You can use a custom OpenTelemetry exporter with @vercel/otel or manual OpenTelemetry configuration.\nCustom Spans\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can add a custom span with OpenTelemetry APIs.\nTerminalnpm install @opentelemetry/api\nThe following example demonstrates a function that fetches GitHub stars and adds a custom fetchGithubStars span to track the fetch request's result:\nimport { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api'\n \nexport async function fetchGithubStars() {\n  return await trace\n    .getTracer('nextjs-example')\n    .startActiveSpan('fetchGithubStars', async (span) => {\n      try {\n        return await getValue()\n      } finally {\n        span.end()\n      }\n    })\n}\nThe register function will execute before your code runs in a new environment.\nYou can start creating new spans, and they should be correctly added to the exported trace.\nDefault Spans in Next.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js automatically instruments several spans for you to provide useful insights into your application's performance.\nAttributes on spans follow OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. We also add some custom attributes under the next namespace:\n\nnext.span_name - duplicates span name\nnext.span_type - each span type has a unique identifier\nnext.route - The route pattern of the request (e.g., /[param]/user).\nnext.rsc (true/false) - Whether the request is an RSC request, such as prefetch.\nnext.page\n\nThis is an internal value used by an app router.\nYou can think about it as a route to a special file (like page.ts, layout.ts, loading.ts and others)\nIt can be used as a unique identifier only when paired with next.route because /layout can be used to identify both /(groupA)/layout.ts and /(groupB)/layout.ts\n\n\n\n[http.method] [next.route]\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nnext.span_type: BaseServer.handleRequest\n\nThis span represents the root span for each incoming request to your Next.js application.

This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.\nEach generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive (this process is called hydration in React).\nPre-rendering\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering. The difference is in when it generates the HTML for a page.\n\nStatic Generation: The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request.\nServer-side Rendering: The HTML is generated on each request.\n\nImportantly, Next.js lets you choose which pre-rendering form you'd like to use for each page. You can create a \"hybrid\" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.\nWe recommend using Static Generation over Server-side Rendering for performance reasons. Statically generated pages can be cached by CDN with no extra configuration to boost performance. However, in some cases, Server-side Rendering might be the only option.\nYou can also use client-side data fetching along with Static Generation or Server-side Rendering. That means some parts of a page can be rendered entirely by clientside JavaScript. To learn more, take a look at the Data Fetching documentation."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_rendering_automatic-static-optimization.txt","text":"Automatic Static OptimizationNext.js automatically determines that a page is static (can be prerendered) if it has no blocking data requirements. This determination is made by the absence of getServerSideProps and getInitialProps in the page.\nThis feature allows Next.js to emit hybrid applications that contain both server-rendered and statically generated pages.\n\nStatically generated pages are still reactive: Next.js will hydrate your application client-side to give it full interactivity.\n\nOne of the main benefits of this feature is that optimized pages require no server-side computation, and can be instantly streamed to the end-user from multiple CDN locations. The result is an ultra fast loading experience for your users.\nHow it works\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf getServerSideProps or getInitialProps is present in a page, Next.js will switch to render the page on-demand, per-request (meaning Server-Side Rendering).\nIf the above is not the case, Next.js will statically optimize your page automatically by prerendering the page to static HTML.\nDuring prerendering, the router's query object will be empty since we do not have query information to provide during this phase. After hydration, Next.js will trigger an update to your application to provide the route parameters in the query object.\nThe cases where the query will be updated after hydration triggering another render are:\n\nThe page is a dynamic-route.\nThe page has query values in the URL.\nRewrites are configured in your next.config.js since these can have parameters that may need to be parsed and provided in the query.\n\nTo be able to distinguish if the query is fully updated and ready for use, you can leverage the isReady field on next/router.\n\nGood to know: Parameters added with dynamic routes to a page that's using getStaticProps will always be available inside the query object.\n\nnext build will emit .html files for statically optimized pages. For example, the result for the page pages/about.js would be:\nTerminal.next/server/pages/about.html\nAnd if you add getServerSideProps to the page, it will then be JavaScript, like so:\nTerminal.next/server/pages/about.js\nCaveats\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nIf you have a custom App with getInitialProps then this optimization will be turned off in pages without Static Generation.\nIf you have a custom Document with getInitialProps be sure you check if ctx.req is defined before assuming the page is server-side rendered. ctx.req will be undefined for pages that are prerendered.\nAvoid using the asPath value on next/router in the rendering tree until the router's isReady field is true. Statically optimized pages only know asPath on the client and not the server, so using it as a prop may lead to mismatch errors.

When the application is first loaded, the user may notice a slight delay before they can see the full page, this is because the page isn't fully rendered until all the JavaScript is downloaded, parsed, and executed.\nAfter the page has been loaded for the first time, navigating to other pages on the same website is typically faster, as only necessary data needs to be fetched, and JavaScript can re-render parts of the page without requiring a full page refresh.\nIn Next.js, there are two ways you can implement client-side rendering:\n\nUsing React's useEffect() hook inside your pages instead of the server-side rendering methods (getStaticProps and getServerSideProps).\nUsing a data fetching library like SWR or TanStack Query to fetch data on the client (recommended).\n\nHere's an example of using useEffect() inside a Next.js page:\npages/index.jsimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n \nexport function Page() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n      if (!response.ok) {\n        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`)\n      }\n      const result = await response.json()\n      setData(result)\n    }\n \n    fetchData().catch((e) => {\n      // handle the error as needed\n      console.error('An error occurred while fetching the data: ', e)\n    })\n  }, [])\n \n  return <p>{data ? `Your data: ${data}` : 'Loading...'}</p>\n}\nIn the example above, the component starts by rendering Loading.... Then, once the data is fetched, it re-renders and displays the data.\nAlthough fetching data in a useEffect is a pattern you may see in older React Applications, we recommend using a data-fetching library for better performance, caching, optimistic updates, and more. Here's a minimum example using SWR to fetch data on the client:\npages/index.jsimport useSWR from 'swr'\n \nexport function Page() {\n  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(\n    'https://api.example.com/data',\n    fetcher\n  )\n \n  if (error) return <p>Failed to load.</p>\n  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>\n \n  return <p>Your Data: {data}</p>\n}\n\nGood to know:\nKeep in mind that CSR can impact SEO. Some search engine crawlers might not execute JavaScript and therefore only see the initial empty or loading state of your application. It can also lead to performance issues for users with slower internet connections or devices, as they need to wait for all the JavaScript to load and run before they can see the full page. Next.js promotes a hybrid approach that allows you to use a combination of server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering, depending on the needs of each page in your application. In the App Router, you can also use Loading UI with Suspense to show a loading indicator while the page is being rendered.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_rendering_edge-and-nodejs-runtimes.txt","text":"Edge and Node.js Runtimes\nIn the context of Next.js, runtime refers to the set of libraries, APIs, and general functionality available to your code during execution.\nOn the server, there are two runtimes where parts of your application code can be rendered:\n\nThe Node.js Runtime (default) has access to all Node.js APIs and compatible packages from the ecosystem.\nThe Edge Runtime is based on Web APIs.\n\nRuntime Differences\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are many considerations to make when choosing a runtime. This table shows the major differences at a glance. If you want a more in-depth analysis of the differences, check out the sections below.\nNodeServerlessEdgeCold Boot/NormalLowHTTP StreamingYesYesYesIOAllAllfetchScalability/HighHighestSecurityNormalHighHighLatencyNormalLowLowestnpm PackagesAllAllA smaller subsetStatic RenderingYesYesNoDynamic RenderingYesYesYesData Revalidation w/ fetchYesYesYes\nEdge Runtime\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn Next.js, the lightweight Edge Runtime is a subset of available Node.js APIs.\nThe Edge Runtime is ideal if you need to deliver dynamic, personalized content at low latency with small, simple functions. The Edge Runtime's speed comes from its minimal use of resources, but that can be limiting in many scenarios.\nFor example, code executed in the Edge Runtime on Vercel cannot exceed between 1 MB and 4 MB, this limit includes imported packages, fonts and files, and will vary depending on your deployment infrastructure. In addition, the Edge Runtime does not support all Node.js APIs meaning some npm packages may not work. For example, \"Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'\" or similar errors. We recommend using the Node.js runtime if you need to use these APIs or packages.\nNode.js Runtime\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUsing the Node.js runtime gives you access to all Node.js APIs, and all npm packages that rely on them. However, it's not as fast to start up as routes using the Edge runtime.\nDeploying your Next.js application to a Node.js server will require managing, scaling, and configuring your infrastructure. Alternatively, you can consider deploying your Next.js application to a serverless platform like Vercel, which will handle this for you.\nServerless Node.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nServerless is ideal if you need a scalable solution that can handle more complex computational loads than the Edge Runtime. With Serverless Functions on Vercel, for example, your overall code size is 50MB including imported packages, fonts, and files.\nThe downside compared to routes using the Edge is that it can take hundreds of milliseconds for Serverless Functions to boot up before they begin processing requests. Depending on the amount of traffic your site receives, this could be a frequent occurrence as the functions are not frequently \"warm\".\n\n\nPlease refer to the Node.js Docs and Edge Docs for the full list of available APIs. Both runtimes can also support streaming depending on your deployment infrastructure.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_rendering_server-side-rendering.txt","text":"Server-side Rendering (SSR)\nAlso referred to as \"SSR\" or \"Dynamic Rendering\".\n\nIf a page uses Server-side Rendering, the page HTML is generated on each request.\nTo use Server-side Rendering for a page, you need to export an async function called getServerSideProps. This function will be called by the server on every request.\nFor example, suppose that your page needs to pre-render frequently updated data (fetched from an external API). You can write getServerSideProps which fetches this data and passes it to Page like below:\nexport default function Page({ data }) {\n  // Render data...\n}\n \n// This gets called on every request\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  // Fetch data from external API\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  // Pass data to the page via props\n  return { props: { data } }\n}\nAs you can see, getServerSideProps is similar to getStaticProps, but the difference is that getServerSideProps is run on every request instead of on build time.\nTo learn more about how getServerSideProps works, check out our Data Fetching documentation."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_rendering_static-site-generation.txt","text":"Static Site Generation (SSG)Examples\nWordPress Example(Demo)\nBlog Starter using markdown files (Demo)\nDatoCMS Example (Demo)\nTakeShape Example (Demo)\nSanity Example (Demo)\nPrismic Example (Demo)\nContentful Example (Demo)\nStrapi Example (Demo)\nPrepr Example (Demo)\nAgility CMS Example (Demo)\nCosmic Example (Demo)\nButterCMS Example (Demo)\nStoryblok Example (Demo)\nGraphCMS Example (Demo)\nKontent Example (Demo)\nBuilder.io Example (Demo)\nTinaCMS Example (Demo)\nStatic Tweet (Demo)\nEnterspeed Example (Demo)\n\nIf a page uses Static Generation, the page HTML is generated at build time. That means in production, the page HTML is generated when you run next build. This HTML will then be reused on each request. It can be cached by a CDN.\nIn Next.js, you can statically generate pages with or without data. Let's take a look at each case.\nStatic Generation without data\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy default, Next.js pre-renders pages using Static Generation without fetching data. Here's an example:\nfunction About() {\n  return <div>About</div>\n}\n \nexport default About\nNote that this page does not need to fetch any external data to be pre-rendered. In cases like this, Next.js generates a single HTML file per page during build time.\nStatic Generation with data\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSome pages require fetching external data for pre-rendering. There are two scenarios, and one or both might apply. In each case, you can use these functions that Next.js provides:\n\nYour page content depends on external data: Use getStaticProps.\nYour page paths depend on external data: Use getStaticPaths (usually in addition to getStaticProps).\n\nScenario 1: Your page content depends on external data\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nExample: Your blog page might need to fetch the list of blog posts from a CMS (content management system).\n// TODO: Need to fetch `posts` (by calling some API endpoint)\n//       before this page can be pre-rendered.\nexport default function Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li>{post.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\nTo fetch this data on pre-render, Next.js allows you to export an async function called getStaticProps from the same file. This function gets called at build time and lets you pass fetched data to the page's props on pre-render.\nexport default function Blog({ posts }) {\n  // Render posts...\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n  }\n}\nTo learn more about how getStaticProps works, check out the Data Fetching documentation.\nScenario 2: Your page paths depend on external data\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js allows you to create pages with dynamic routes. For example, you can create a file called pages/posts/[id].js to show a single blog post based on id. This will allow you to show a blog post with id: 1 when you access posts/1.\n\nTo learn more about dynamic routing, check the Dynamic Routing documentation.\n\nHowever, which id you want to pre-render at build time might depend on external data.\nExample: suppose that you've only added one blog post (with id: 1) to the database. In this case, you'd only want to pre-render posts/1 at build time.\nLater, you might add the second post with id: 2. Then you'd want to pre-render posts/2 as well.\nSo your page paths that are pre-rendered depend on external data. To handle this, Next.js lets you export an async function called getStaticPaths from a dynamic page (pages/posts/[id].js in this case). This function gets called at build time and lets you specify which paths you want to pre-render.\n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n \n  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.\n  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.\n  return { paths, fallback: false }\n}\nAlso in pages/posts/[id].js, you need to export getStaticProps so that you can fetch the data about the post with this id and use it to pre-render the page:\nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  // Render post...\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // ...\n}\n \n// This also gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  // params contains the post `id`.\n  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  // Pass post data to the page via props\n  return { props: { post } }\n}\nTo learn more about how getStaticPaths works, check out the Data Fetching documentation.\nWhen should I use Static Generation?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWe recommend using Static Generation (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.\nYou can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:\n\nMarketing pages\nBlog posts and portfolios\nE-commerce product listings\nHelp and documentation\n\nYou should ask yourself: \"Can I pre-render this page ahead of a user's request?\" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.\nOn the other hand, Static Generation is not a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.\nIn cases like this, you can do one of the following:\n\nUse Static Generation with Client-side data fetching: You can skip pre-rendering some parts of a page and then use client-side JavaScript to populate them. To learn more about this approach, check out the Data Fetching documentation.\nUse Server-Side Rendering: Next.js pre-renders a page on each request. It will be slower because the page cannot be cached by a CDN, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. We'll talk about this approach below.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_routing.txt","text":"RoutingThe Pages Router has a file-system based router built on concepts of pages.

They are server-side only bundles and won't increase your client-side bundle size.\nFor example, the following API route returns a JSON response with a status code of 200:\npages/api/hello.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \ntype ResponseData = {\n  message: string\n}\n \nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>\n) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nAPI Routes do not specify CORS headers, meaning they are same-origin only by default. You can customize such behavior by wrapping the request handler with the CORS request helpers.\n\n\n\nAPI Routes can't be used with static exports. However, Route Handlers in the App Router can.\n\n\nAPI Routes will be affected by pageExtensions configuration in next.config.js.\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nreq: An instance of http.IncomingMessage\nres: An instance of http.ServerResponse\n\nHTTP Methods\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo handle different HTTP methods in an API route, you can use req.method in your request handler, like so:\npages/api/hello.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    // Process a POST request\n  } else {\n    // Handle any other HTTP method\n  }\n}\n\nRequest Helpers\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAPI Routes provide built-in request helpers which parse the incoming request (req):\n\nreq.cookies - An object containing the cookies sent by the request. Defaults to {}\nreq.query - An object containing the query string. Defaults to {}\nreq.body - An object containing the body parsed by content-type, or null if no body was sent\n\nCustom config\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nEvery API Route can export a config object to change the default configuration, which is the following:\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: {\n      sizeLimit: '1mb',\n    },\n  },\n  // Specifies the maximum allowed duration for this function to execute (in seconds)\n  maxDuration: 5,\n}\nbodyParser is automatically enabled. If you want to consume the body as a Stream or with raw-body, you can set this to false.\nOne use case for disabling the automatic bodyParsing is to allow you to verify the raw body of a webhook request, for example from GitHub.\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: false,\n  },\n}\nbodyParser.sizeLimit is the maximum size allowed for the parsed body, in any format supported by bytes, like so:\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: {\n      sizeLimit: '500kb',\n    },\n  },\n}\nexternalResolver is an explicit flag that tells the server that this route is being handled by an external resolver like express or connect. Enabling this option disables warnings for unresolved requests.\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    externalResolver: true,\n  },\n}\nresponseLimit is automatically enabled, warning when an API Routes' response body is over 4MB.\nIf you are not using Next.js in a serverless environment, and understand the performance implications of not using a CDN or dedicated media host, you can set this limit to false.\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    responseLimit: false,\n  },\n}\nresponseLimit can also take the number of bytes or any string format supported by bytes, for example 1000, '500kb' or '3mb'.\nThis value will be the maximum response size before a warning is displayed. Default is 4MB. (see above)\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    responseLimit: '8mb',\n  },\n}\nResponse Helpers\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe Server Response object, (often abbreviated as res) includes a set of Express.js-like helper methods to improve the developer experience and increase the speed of creating new API endpoints.\nThe included helpers are:\n\nres.status(code) - A function to set the status code. code must be a valid HTTP status code\nres.json(body) - Sends a JSON response. body must be a serializable object\nres.send(body) - Sends the HTTP response. body can be a string, an object or a Buffer\nres.redirect([status,] path) - Redirects to a specified path or URL. status must be a valid HTTP status code. If not specified, status defaults to \"307\" \"Temporary redirect\".\nres.revalidate(urlPath) - Revalidate a page on demand using getStaticProps. urlPath must be a string.\n\nSetting the status code of a response\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen sending a response back to the client, you can set the status code of the response.\nThe following example sets the status code of the response to 200 (OK) and returns a message property with the value of Hello from Next.js! as a JSON response:\npages/api/hello.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \ntype ResponseData = {\n  message: string\n}\n \nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>\n) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })\n}\n\nSending a JSON response\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen sending a response back to the client you can send a JSON response, this must be a serializable object.\nIn a real world application you might want to let the client know the status of the request depending on the result of the requested endpoint.\nThe following example sends a JSON response with the status code 200 (OK) and the result of the async operation. It's contained in a try catch block to handle any errors that may occur, with the appropriate status code and error message caught and sent back to the client:\npages/api/hello.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const result = await someAsyncOperation()\n    res.status(200).json({ result })\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'failed to load data' })\n  }\n}\n\nSending a HTTP response\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSending an HTTP response works the same way as when sending a JSON response. The only difference is that the response body can be a string, an object or a Buffer.\nThe following example sends a HTTP response with the status code 200 (OK) and the result of the async operation.\npages/api/hello.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const result = await someAsyncOperation()\n    res.status(200).send({ result })\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).send({ error: 'failed to fetch data' })\n  }\n}\n\nRedirects to a specified path or URL\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTaking a form as an example, you may want to redirect your client to a specified path or URL once they have submitted the form.\nThe following example redirects the client to the / path if the form is successfully submitted:\npages/api/hello.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const { name, message } = req.body\n \n  try {\n    await handleFormInputAsync({ name, message })\n    res.redirect(307, '/')\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Failed to fetch data' })\n  }\n}\n\nAdding TypeScript types\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can make your API Routes more type-safe by importing the NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse types from next, in addition to those, you can also type your response data:\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \ntype ResponseData = {\n  message: string\n}\n \nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>\n) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })\n}\n\nGood to know: The body of NextApiRequest is any because the client may include any payload. You should validate the type/shape of the body at runtime before using it.\n\nDynamic API Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAPI Routes support dynamic routes, and follow the same file naming rules used for pages/.\npages/api/post/[pid].tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const { pid } = req.query\n  res.end(`Post: ${pid}`)\n}\n\nNow, a request to /api/post/abc will respond with the text: Post: abc.\nCatch all API routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAPI Routes can be extended to catch all paths by adding three dots (...) inside the brackets. For example:\n\npages/api/post/[...slug].js matches /api/post/a, but also /api/post/a/b, /api/post/a/b/c and so on.\n\n\nGood to know: You can use names other than slug, such as: [...param]\n\nMatched parameters will be sent as a query parameter (slug in the example) to the page, and it will always be an array, so, the path /api/post/a will have the following query object:\n{ \"slug\": [\"a\"] }\nAnd in the case of /api/post/a/b, and any other matching path, new parameters will be added to the array, like so:\n{ \"slug\": [\"a\", \"b\"] }\nFor example:\npages/api/post/[...slug].tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const { slug } = req.query\n  res.end(`Post: ${slug.join(', ')}`)\n}\n\nNow, a request to /api/post/a/b/c will respond with the text: Post: a, b, c.\nOptional catch all API routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCatch all routes can be made optional by including the parameter in double brackets ([[...slug]]).\nFor example, pages/api/post/[[...slug]].js will match /api/post, /api/post/a, /api/post/a/b, and so on.\nThe main difference between catch all and optional catch all routes is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (/api/post in the example above).\nThe query objects are as follows:\n{ } // GET `/api/post` (empty object)\n{ \"slug\": [\"a\"] } // `GET /api/post/a` (single-element array)\n{ \"slug\": [\"a\", \"b\"] } // `GET /api/post/a/b` (multi-element array)\nCaveats\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nPredefined API routes take precedence over dynamic API routes, and dynamic API routes over catch all API routes. Take a look at the following examples:\n\npages/api/post/create.js - Will match /api/post/create\npages/api/post/[pid].js - Will match /api/post/1, /api/post/abc, etc. But not /api/post/create\npages/api/post/[...slug].js - Will match /api/post/1/2, /api/post/a/b/c, etc. But not /api/post/create, /api/post/abc\n\n\n\nEdge API Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you would like to use API Routes with the Edge Runtime, we recommend incrementally adopting the App Router and using Route Handlers instead.\nThe Route Handlers function signature is isomorphic, meaning you can use the same function for both Edge and Node.js runtimes."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_routing_custom-app.txt","text":"Custom AppNext.js uses the App component to initialize pages.

You can provide a list of locales, the default locale, and domain-specific locales and Next.js will automatically handle the routing.\nThe i18n routing support is currently meant to complement existing i18n library solutions like react-intl, react-i18next, lingui, rosetta, next-intl, next-translate, next-multilingual, tolgee, and others by streamlining the routes and locale parsing.\nGetting started\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo get started, add the i18n config to your next.config.js file.\nLocales are UTS Locale Identifiers, a standardized format for defining locales.\nGenerally a Locale Identifier is made up of a language, region, and script separated by a dash: language-region-script. The region and script are optional. An example:\n\nen-US - English as spoken in the United States\nnl-NL - Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands\nnl - Dutch, no specific region\n\nIf user locale is nl-BE and it is not listed in your configuration, they will be redirected to nl if available, or to the default locale otherwise.\nIf you don't plan to support all regions of a country, it is therefore a good practice to include country locales that will act as fallbacks.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    // These are all the locales you want to support in\n    // your application\n    locales: ['en-US', 'fr', 'nl-NL'],\n    // This is the default locale you want to be used when visiting\n    // a non-locale prefixed path e.g. `/hello`\n    defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n    // This is a list of locale domains and the default locale they\n    // should handle (these are only required when setting up domain routing)\n    // Note: subdomains must be included in the domain value to be matched e.g. \"fr.example.com\".\n    domains: [\n      {\n        domain: 'example.com',\n        defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.nl',\n        defaultLocale: 'nl-NL',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.fr',\n        defaultLocale: 'fr',\n        // an optional http field can also be used to test\n        // locale domains locally with http instead of https\n        http: true,\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\nLocale Strategies\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are two locale handling strategies: Sub-path Routing and Domain Routing.\nSub-path Routing\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSub-path Routing puts the locale in the url path.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en-US', 'fr', 'nl-NL'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n  },\n}\nWith the above configuration en-US, fr, and nl-NL will be available to be routed to, and en-US is the default locale. If you have a pages/blog.js the following urls would be available:\n\n/blog\n/fr/blog\n/nl-nl/blog\n\nThe default locale does not have a prefix.\nDomain Routing\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nBy using domain routing you can configure locales to be served from different domains:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en-US', 'fr', 'nl-NL', 'nl-BE'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n \n    domains: [\n      {\n        // Note: subdomains must be included in the domain value to be matched\n        // e.g. www.example.com should be used if that is the expected hostname\n        domain: 'example.com',\n        defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.fr',\n        defaultLocale: 'fr',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.nl',\n        defaultLocale: 'nl-NL',\n        // specify other locales that should be redirected\n        // to this domain\n        locales: ['nl-BE'],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\nFor example if you have pages/blog.js the following urls will be available:\n\nexample.com/blog\nwww.example.com/blog\nexample.fr/blog\nexample.nl/blog\nexample.nl/nl-BE/blog\n\nAutomatic Locale Detection\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen a user visits the application root (generally /), Next.js will try to automatically detect which locale the user prefers based on the Accept-Language header and the current domain.\nIf a locale other than the default locale is detected, the user will be redirected to either:\n\nWhen using Sub-path Routing: The locale prefixed path\nWhen using Domain Routing: The domain with that locale specified as the default\n\nWhen using Domain Routing, if a user with the Accept-Language header fr;q=0.9 visits example.com, they will be redirected to example.fr since that domain handles the fr locale by default.\nWhen using Sub-path Routing, the user would be redirected to /fr.\nPrefixing the Default Locale\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWith Next.js 12 and Middleware, we can add a prefix to the default locale with a workaround.\nFor example, here's a next.config.js file with support for a few languages. Note the \"default\" locale has been added intentionally.\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['default', 'en', 'de', 'fr'],\n    defaultLocale: 'default',\n    localeDetection: false,\n  },\n  trailingSlash: true,\n}\nNext, we can use Middleware to add custom routing rules:\nmiddleware.tsimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nconst PUBLIC_FILE = /\\.(.*)$/\n \nexport async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {\n  if (\n    req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/_next') ||\n    req.nextUrl.pathname.includes('/api/') ||\n    PUBLIC_FILE.test(req.nextUrl.pathname)\n  ) {\n    return\n  }\n \n  if (req.nextUrl.locale === 'default') {\n    const locale = req.cookies.get('NEXT_LOCALE')?.value || 'en'\n \n    return NextResponse.redirect(\n      new URL(`/${locale}${req.nextUrl.pathname}${req.nextUrl.search}`, req.url)\n    )\n  }\n}\nThis Middleware skips adding the default prefix to API Routes and public files like fonts or images. If a request is made to the default locale, we redirect to our prefix /en.\nDisabling Automatic Locale Detection\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe automatic locale detection can be disabled with:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    localeDetection: false,\n  },\n}\nWhen localeDetection is set to false Next.js will no longer automatically redirect based on the user's preferred locale and will only provide locale information detected from either the locale based domain or locale path as described above.\nAccessing the locale information\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can access the locale information via the Next.js router. For example, using the useRouter() hook the following properties are available:\n\nlocale contains the currently active locale.\nlocales contains all configured locales.\ndefaultLocale contains the configured default locale.\n\nWhen pre-rendering pages with getStaticProps or getServerSideProps, the locale information is provided in the context provided to the function.\nWhen leveraging getStaticPaths, the configured locales are provided in the context parameter of the function under locales and the configured defaultLocale under defaultLocale.\nTransition between locales\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use next/link or next/router to transition between locales.\nFor next/link, a locale prop can be provided to transition to a different locale from the currently active one. If no locale prop is provided, the currently active locale is used during client-transitions. For example:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function IndexPage(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/another\" locale=\"fr\">\n      To /fr/another\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\nWhen using the next/router methods directly, you can specify the locale that should be used via the transition options. For example:\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function IndexPage(props) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <div\n      onClick={() => {\n        router.push('/another', '/another', { locale: 'fr' })\n      }}\n    >\n      to /fr/another\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nNote that to handle switching only the locale while preserving all routing information such as dynamic route query values or hidden href query values, you can provide the href parameter as an object:\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\nconst router = useRouter()\nconst { pathname, asPath, query } = router\n// change just the locale and maintain all other route information including href's query\nrouter.push({ pathname, query }, asPath, { locale: nextLocale })\nSee here for more information on the object structure for router.push.\nIf you have a href that already includes the locale you can opt-out of automatically handling the locale prefixing:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function IndexPage(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/fr/another\" locale={false}>\n      To /fr/another\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\nLeveraging the NEXT_LOCALE cookie\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js supports overriding the accept-language header with a NEXT_LOCALE=the-locale cookie. This cookie can be set using a language switcher and then when a user comes back to the site it will leverage the locale specified in the cookie when redirecting from / to the correct locale location.\nFor example, if a user prefers the locale fr in their accept-language header but a NEXT_LOCALE=en cookie is set the en locale when visiting / the user will be redirected to the en locale location until the cookie is removed or expired.\nSearch Engine Optimization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSince Next.js knows what language the user is visiting it will automatically add the lang attribute to the <html> tag.\nNext.js doesn't know about variants of a page so it's up to you to add the hreflang meta tags using next/head. You can learn more about hreflang in the Google Webmasters documentation.\nHow does this work with Static Generation?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nNote that Internationalized Routing does not integrate with output: 'export' as it does not leverage the Next.js routing layer. Hybrid Next.js applications that do not use output: 'export' are fully supported.\n\nDynamic Routes and getStaticProps Pages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor pages using getStaticProps with Dynamic Routes, all locale variants of the page desired to be prerendered need to be returned from getStaticPaths. Along with the params object returned for paths, you can also return a locale field specifying which locale you want to render. For example:\npages/blog/[slug].jsexport const getStaticPaths = ({ locales }) => {\n  return {\n    paths: [\n      // if no `locale` is provided only the defaultLocale will be generated\n      { params: { slug: 'post-1' }, locale: 'en-US' },\n      { params: { slug: 'post-1' }, locale: 'fr' },\n    ],\n    fallback: true,\n  }\n}\nFor Automatically Statically Optimized and non-dynamic getStaticProps pages, a version of the page will be generated for each locale. This is important to consider because it can increase build times depending on how many locales are configured inside getStaticProps.\nFor example, if you have 50 locales configured with 10 non-dynamic pages using getStaticProps, this means getStaticProps will be called 500 times. 50 versions of the 10 pages will be generated during each build.\nTo decrease the build time of dynamic pages with getStaticProps, use a fallback mode. This allows you to return only the most popular paths and locales from getStaticPaths for prerendering during the build. Then, Next.js will build the remaining pages at runtime as they are requested.\nAutomatically Statically Optimized Pages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor pages that are automatically statically optimized, a version of the page will be generated for each locale.\nNon-dynamic getStaticProps Pages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor non-dynamic getStaticProps pages, a version is generated for each locale like above. getStaticProps is called with each locale that is being rendered. If you would like to opt-out of a certain locale from being pre-rendered, you can return notFound: true from getStaticProps and this variant of the page will not be generated.\nexport async function getStaticProps({ locale }) {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.\n  // You can use any data fetching library\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts?locale=${locale}`)\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  if (posts.length === 0) {\n    return {\n      notFound: true,\n    }\n  }\n \n  // By returning { props: posts }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n  }\n}\nLimits for the i18n config\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nlocales: 100 total locales\ndomains: 100 total locale domain items\n\n\nGood to know: These limits have been added initially to prevent potential performance issues at build time. You can workaround these limits with custom routing using Middleware in Next.js 12.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_routing_linking-and-navigating.txt","text":"Linking and NavigatingThe Next.js router allows you to do client-side route transitions between pages, similar to a single-page application.\nA React component called Link is provided to do this client-side route transition.\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/about\">About Us</Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/blog/hello-world\">Blog Post</Link>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Home\nThe example above uses multiple links. Each one maps a path (href) to a known page:\n\n/ → pages/index.js\n/about → pages/about.js\n/blog/hello-world → pages/blog/[slug].js\n\nAny <Link /> in the viewport (initially or through scroll) will be prefetched by default (including the corresponding data) for pages using Static Generation. The corresponding data for server-rendered routes is fetched only when the <Link /> is clicked.\nLinking to dynamic paths\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can also use interpolation to create the path, which comes in handy for dynamic route segments. For example, to show a list of posts which have been passed to the component as a prop:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Posts({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link href={`/blog/${encodeURIComponent(post.slug)}`}>\n            {post.title}\n          </Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Posts\n\nencodeURIComponent is used in the example to keep the path utf-8 compatible.\n\nAlternatively, using a URL Object:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Posts({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link\n            href={{\n              pathname: '/blog/[slug]',\n              query: { slug: post.slug },\n            }}\n          >\n            {post.title}\n          </Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Posts\nNow, instead of using interpolation to create the path, we use a URL object in href where:\n\npathname is the name of the page in the pages directory. /blog/[slug] in this case.\nquery is an object with the dynamic segment. slug in this case.\n\nInjecting the router\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nExamples\nDynamic Routing\n\nTo access the router object in a React component you can use useRouter or withRouter.\nIn general we recommend using useRouter.\nImperative Routing\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nnext/link should be able to cover most of your routing needs, but you can also do client-side navigations without it, take a look at the documentation for next/router.\nThe following example shows how to do basic page navigations with useRouter:\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function ReadMore() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>\n      Click here to read more\n    </button>\n  )\n}\nShallow Routing\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nExamples\nShallow Routing\n\nShallow routing allows you to change the URL without running data fetching methods again, that includes getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and getInitialProps.\nYou'll receive the updated pathname and the query via the router object (added by useRouter or withRouter), without losing state.\nTo enable shallow routing, set the shallow option to true. Consider the following example:\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \n// Current URL is '/'\nfunction Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Always do navigations after the first render\n    router.push('/?counter=10', undefined, { shallow: true })\n  }, [])\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // The counter changed!\n  }, [router.query.counter])\n}\n \nexport default Page\nThe URL will get updated to /?counter=10 and the page won't get replaced, only the state of the route is changed.\nYou can also watch for URL changes via componentDidUpdate as shown below:\ncomponentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n  const { pathname, query } = this.props.router\n  // verify props have changed to avoid an infinite loop\n  if (query.counter !== prevProps.router.query.counter) {\n    // fetch data based on the new query\n  }\n}\nCaveats\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nShallow routing only works for URL changes in the current page. For example, let's assume we have another page called pages/about.js, and you run this:\nrouter.push('/?counter=10', '/about?counter=10', { shallow: true })\nSince that's a new page, it'll unload the current page, load the new one and wait for data fetching even though we asked to do shallow routing.\nWhen shallow routing is used with middleware it will not ensure the new page matches the current page like previously done without middleware. This is due to middleware being able to rewrite dynamically and can't be verified client-side without a data fetch which is skipped with shallow, so a shallow route change must always be treated as shallow."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_routing_middleware.txt","text":"Middleware\nMiddleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.\nMiddleware runs before cached content and routes are matched. See Matching Paths for more details.\nUse Cases\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIntegrating Middleware into your application can lead to significant improvements in performance, security, and user experience. Some common scenarios where Middleware is particularly effective include:\n\nAuthentication and Authorization: Ensure user identity and check session cookies before granting access to specific pages or API routes.\nServer-Side Redirects: Redirect users at the server level based on certain conditions (e.g., locale, user role).\nPath Rewriting: Support A/B testing, feature rollouts, or legacy paths by dynamically rewriting paths to API routes or pages based on request properties.\nBot Detection: Protect your resources by detecting and blocking bot traffic.\nLogging and Analytics: Capture and analyze request data for insights before processing by the page or API.\nFeature Flagging: Enable or disable features dynamically for seamless feature rollouts or testing.\n\nRecognizing situations where middleware may not be the optimal approach is just as crucial. Here are some scenarios to be mindful of:\n\nComplex Data Fetching and Manipulation: Middleware is not designed for direct data fetching or manipulation, this should be done within Route Handlers or server-side utilities instead.\nHeavy Computational Tasks: Middleware should be lightweight and respond quickly or it can cause delays in page load. Heavy computational tasks or long-running processes should be done within dedicated Route Handlers.\nExtensive Session Management: While Middleware can manage basic session tasks, extensive session management should be managed by dedicated authentication services or within Route Handlers.\nDirect Database Operations: Performing direct database operations within Middleware is not recommended. Database interactions should done within Route Handlers or server-side utilities.\n\nConvention\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUse the file middleware.ts (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as pages or app, or inside src if applicable.\n\nNote: While only one middleware.ts file is supported per project, you can still organize your middleware logic modularly. Break out middleware functionalities into separate .ts or .js files and import them into your main middleware.ts file. This allows for cleaner management of route-specific middleware, aggregated in the middleware.ts for centralized control. By enforcing a single middleware file, it simplifies configuration, prevents potential conflicts, and optimizes performance by avoiding multiple middleware layers.\n\nExample\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \n// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))\n}\n \n// See \"Matching Paths\" below to learn more\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\n\nMatching Paths\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware will be invoked for every route in your project. Given this, it's crucial to use matchers to precisely target or exclude specific routes. The following is the execution order:\n\nheaders from next.config.js\nredirects from next.config.js\nMiddleware (rewrites, redirects, etc.)\nbeforeFiles (rewrites) from next.config.js\nFilesystem routes (public/, _next/static/, pages/, app/, etc.)\nafterFiles (rewrites) from next.config.js\nDynamic Routes (/blog/[slug])\nfallback (rewrites) from next.config.js\n\nThere are two ways to define which paths Middleware will run on:\n\nCustom matcher config\nConditional statements\n\nMatcher\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nmatcher allows you to filter Middleware to run on specific paths.\nmiddleware.jsexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\nYou can match a single path or multiple paths with an array syntax:\nmiddleware.jsexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/about/:path*', '/dashboard/:path*'],\n}\nThe matcher config allows full regex so matching like negative lookaheads or character matching is supported. An example of a negative lookahead to match all except specific paths can be seen here:\nmiddleware.jsexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n  ],\n}\nYou can also bypass Middleware for certain requests by using the missing or has arrays, or a combination of both:\nmiddleware.jsexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      missing: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n \n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      has: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n \n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      has: [{ type: 'header', key: 'x-present' }],\n      missing: [{ type: 'header', key: 'x-missing', value: 'prefetch' }],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n\nGood to know: The matcher values need to be constants so they can be statically analyzed at build-time. Dynamic values such as variables will be ignored.\n\nConfigured matchers:\n\nMUST start with /\nCan include named parameters: /about/:path matches /about/a and /about/b but not /about/a/c\nCan have modifiers on named parameters (starting with :): /about/:path* matches /about/a/b/c because * is zero or more. ? is zero or one and + one or more\nCan use regular expression enclosed in parenthesis: /about/(.*) is the same as /about/:path*\n\nRead more details on path-to-regexp documentation.\n\nGood to know: For backward compatibility, Next.js always considers /public as /public/index.

Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.\nExample: If you create pages/about.js that exports a React component like below, it will be accessible at /about.\nexport default function About() {\n  return <div>About</div>\n}\nIndex routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe router will automatically route files named index to the root of the directory.\n\npages/index.js → /\npages/blog/index.js → /blog\n\nNested routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe router supports nested files. If you create a nested folder structure, files will automatically be routed in the same way still.\n\npages/blog/first-post.js → /blog/first-post\npages/dashboard/settings/username.js → /dashboard/settings/username\n\nPages with Dynamic Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js supports pages with dynamic routes. For example, if you create a file called pages/posts/[id].js, then it will be accessible at posts/1, posts/2, etc.\n\nTo learn more about dynamic routing, check the Dynamic Routing documentation.\n\nLayout Pattern\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe React model allows us to deconstruct a page into a series of components. Many of these components are often reused between pages. For example, you might have the same navigation bar and footer on every page.\ncomponents/layout.jsimport Navbar from './navbar'\nimport Footer from './footer'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Navbar />\n      <main>{children}</main>\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  )\n}\nExamples\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSingle Shared Layout with Custom App\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you only have one layout for your entire application, you can create a Custom App and wrap your application with the layout. Since the <Layout /> component is re-used when changing pages, its component state will be preserved (e.g. input values).\npages/_app.jsimport Layout from '../components/layout'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\nPer-Page Layouts\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you need multiple layouts, you can add a property getLayout to your page, allowing you to return a React component for the layout. This allows you to define the layout on a per-page basis. Since we're returning a function, we can have complex nested layouts if desired.\npages/index.js \nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\nimport NestedLayout from '../components/nested-layout'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    /** Your content */\n  )\n}\n \nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <NestedLayout>{page}</NestedLayout>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\npages/_app.jsexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  // Use the layout defined at the page level, if available\n  const getLayout = Component.getLayout ?? ((page) => page)\n \n  return getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />)\n}\nWhen navigating between pages, we want to persist page state (input values, scroll position, etc.) for a Single-Page Application (SPA) experience.\nThis layout pattern enables state persistence because the React component tree is maintained between page transitions. With the component tree, React can understand which elements have changed to preserve state.\n\nGood to know: This process is called reconciliation, which is how React understands which elements have changed.\n\nWith TypeScript\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWhen using TypeScript, you must first create a new type for your pages which includes a getLayout function. Then, you must create a new type for your AppProps which overrides the Component property to use the previously created type.\npages/index.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { ReactElement } from 'react'\nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\nimport NestedLayout from '../components/nested-layout'\nimport type { NextPageWithLayout } from './_app'\n \nconst Page: NextPageWithLayout = () => {\n  return <p>hello world</p>\n}\n \nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page: ReactElement) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <NestedLayout>{page}</NestedLayout>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Page\n\npages/_app.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { ReactElement, ReactNode } from 'react'\nimport type { NextPage } from 'next'\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n \nexport type NextPageWithLayout<P = {}, IP = P> = NextPage<P, IP> & {\n  getLayout?: (page: ReactElement) => ReactNode\n}\n \ntype AppPropsWithLayout = AppProps & {\n  Component: NextPageWithLayout\n}\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppPropsWithLayout) {\n  // Use the layout defined at the page level, if available\n  const getLayout = Component.getLayout ??

See managing redirects at scale for more.\nredirects runs before Middleware.\n\n\nNextResponse.redirect in Middleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, redirect to a different URL using NextResponse.redirect. This is useful if you want to redirect users based on a condition (e.g. authentication, session management, etc) or have a large number of redirects.\nFor example, to redirect the user to a /login page if they are not authenticated:\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { authenticate } from 'auth-provider'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const isAuthenticated = authenticate(request)\n \n  // If the user is authenticated, continue as normal\n  if (isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.next()\n  }\n \n  // Redirect to login page if not authenticated\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/dashboard/:path*',\n}\n\n\nGood to know:\n\nMiddleware runs after redirects in next.config.js and before rendering.\n\n\nSee the Middleware documentation for more information.\nManaging redirects at scale (advanced)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo manage a large number of redirects (1000+), you may consider creating a custom solution using Middleware. This allows you to handle redirects programmatically without having to redeploy your application.\nTo do this, you'll need to consider:\n\nCreating and storing a redirect map.\nOptimizing data lookup performance.\n\n\nNext.js Example: See our Middleware with Bloom filter example for an implementation of the recommendations below.\n\n1. Creating and storing a redirect map\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA redirect map is a list of redirects that you can store in a database (usually a key-value store) or JSON file.\nConsider the following data structure:\n{\n  \"/old\": {\n    \"destination\": \"/new\",\n    \"permanent\": true\n  },\n  \"/blog/post-old\": {\n    \"destination\": \"/blog/post-new\",\n    \"permanent\": true\n  }\n}\nIn Middleware, you can read from a database such as Vercel's Edge Config or Redis, and redirect the user based on the incoming request:\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { get } from '@vercel/edge-config'\n \ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n \nexport async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname\n  const redirectData = await get(pathname)\n \n  if (redirectData && typeof redirectData === 'string') {\n    const redirectEntry: RedirectEntry = JSON.parse(redirectData)\n    const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307\n    return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)\n  }\n \n  // No redirect found, continue without redirecting\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n\n2. Optimizing data lookup performance\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nReading a large dataset for every incoming request can be slow and expensive. There are two ways you can optimize data lookup performance:\n\nUse a database that is optimized for fast reads, such as Vercel Edge Config or Redis.\nUse a data lookup strategy such as a Bloom filter to efficiently check if a redirect exists before reading the larger redirects file or database.\n\nConsidering the previous example, you can import a generated bloom filter file into Middleware, then, check if the incoming request pathname exists in the bloom filter.\nIf it does, forward the request to a  API Routes which will check the actual file and redirect the user to the appropriate URL. This avoids importing a large redirects file into Middleware, which can slow down every incoming request.\nmiddleware.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { ScalableBloomFilter } from 'bloom-filters'\nimport GeneratedBloomFilter from './redirects/bloom-filter.json'\n \ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n \n// Initialize bloom filter from a generated JSON file\nconst bloomFilter = ScalableBloomFilter.fromJSON(GeneratedBloomFilter as any)\n \nexport async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Get the path for the incoming request\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname\n \n  // Check if the path is in the bloom filter\n  if (bloomFilter.has(pathname)) {\n    // Forward the pathname to the Route Handler\n    const api = new URL(\n      `/api/redirects?pathname=${encodeURIComponent(request.nextUrl.pathname)}`,\n      request.nextUrl.origin\n    )\n \n    try {\n      // Fetch redirect data from the Route Handler\n      const redirectData = await fetch(api)\n \n      if (redirectData.ok) {\n        const redirectEntry: RedirectEntry | undefined =\n          await redirectData.json()\n \n        if (redirectEntry) {\n          // Determine the status code\n          const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307\n \n          // Redirect to the destination\n          return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)\n        }\n      }\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(error)\n    }\n  }\n \n  // No redirect found, continue the request without redirecting\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n\n\nThen, in the API Route:pages/api/redirects.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\nimport redirects from '@/app/redirects/redirects.json'\n \ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const pathname = req.query.pathname\n  if (!pathname) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Bad Request' })\n  }\n \n  // Get the redirect entry from the redirects.json file\n  const redirect = (redirects as Record<string, RedirectEntry>)[pathname]\n \n  // Account for bloom filter false positives\n  if (!redirect) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'No redirect' })\n  }\n \n  // Return the redirect entry\n  return res.json(redirect)\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nTo generate a bloom filter, you can use a library like bloom-filters.\nYou should validate requests made to your Route Handler to prevent malicious requests.\n\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_styling.txt","text":"Styling\nNext.js supports different ways of styling your application, including:\n\nGlobal CSS: Simple to use and familiar for those experienced with traditional CSS, but can lead to larger CSS bundles and difficulty managing styles as the application grows.\nCSS Modules: Create locally scoped CSS classes to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.\nTailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid custom designs by composing utility classes.\nSass: A popular CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.\nCSS-in-JS: Embed CSS directly in your JavaScript components, enabling dynamic and scoped styling.\n\nLearn more about each approach by exploring their respective documentation:"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_styling_css-in-js.txt","text":"CSS-in-JS\n\nExamples\nStyled JSX\nStyled Components\nEmotion\nLinaria\nStyletron\nCxs\nFela\nStitches\nIt's possible to use any existing CSS-in-JS solution.

This allows you to use the same class name in different files without worrying about collisions. This behavior makes CSS Modules the ideal way to include component-level CSS.\nExample\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nFor example, consider a reusable Button component in the components/ folder:First, create components/Button.module.css with the following content:Button.module.css/*\nYou do not need to worry about .error {} colliding with any other `.css` or\n`.module.css` files!\n*/\n.error {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: red;\n}Then, create components/Button.js, importing and using the above CSS file:components/Button.jsimport styles from './Button.module.css'\n \nexport function Button() {\n  return (\n    <button\n      type=\"button\"\n      // Note how the \"error\" class is accessed as a property on the imported\n      // `styles` object.\n      className={styles.error}\n    >\n      Destroy\n    </button>\n  )\n}\nCSS Modules are only enabled for files with the .module.css and .module.sass extensions.\nIn production, all CSS Module files will be automatically concatenated into many minified and code-split .css files.\nThese .css files represent hot execution paths in your application, ensuring the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for your application to paint.\nGlobal Styles\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nTo add a stylesheet to your application, import the CSS file within pages/_app.js.For example, consider the following stylesheet named styles.css:styles.cssbody {\n  font-family: 'SF Pro Text', 'SF Pro Icons', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica',\n    'Arial', sans-serif;\n  padding: 20px 20px 60px;\n  max-width: 680px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}Create a pages/_app.js file if not already present.\nThen, import the styles.css file.pages/_app.jsimport '../styles.css'\n \n// This default export is required in a new `pages/_app.js` file.\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}These styles (styles.css) will apply to all pages and components in your application.\nDue to the global nature of stylesheets, and to avoid conflicts, you may only import them inside pages/_app.js.In development, expressing stylesheets this way allows your styles to be hot reloaded as you edit them—meaning you can keep application state.In production, all CSS files will be automatically concatenated into a single minified .css file. The order that the CSS is concatenated will match the order the CSS is imported into the _app.js file. Pay special attention to imported JS modules that include their own CSS; the JS module's CSS will be concatenated following the same ordering rules as imported CSS files. For example:import '../styles.css'\n// The CSS in ErrorBoundary depends on the global CSS in styles.css,\n// so we import it after styles.css.\nimport ErrorBoundary from '../components/ErrorBoundary'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  )\n}\nExternal Stylesheets\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nNext.js allows you to import CSS files from a JavaScript file.\nThis is possible because Next.js extends the concept of import beyond JavaScript.Import styles from node_modules\n  \n    \n    \n  \nSince Next.js 9.5.4, importing a CSS file from node_modules is permitted anywhere in your application.For global stylesheets, like bootstrap or nprogress, you should import the file inside pages/_app.js.\nFor example:pages/_app.jsimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}For importing CSS required by a third-party component, you can do so in your component. For example:components/example-dialog.jsimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { Dialog } from '@reach/dialog'\nimport VisuallyHidden from '@reach/visually-hidden'\nimport '@reach/dialog/styles.css'\n \nfunction ExampleDialog(props) {\n  const [showDialog, setShowDialog] = useState(false)\n  const open = () => setShowDialog(true)\n  const close = () => setShowDialog(false)\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={open}>Open Dialog</button>\n      <Dialog isOpen={showDialog} onDismiss={close}>\n        <button className=\"close-button\" onClick={close}>\n          <VisuallyHidden>Close</VisuallyHidden>\n          <span aria-hidden>×</span>\n        </button>\n        <p>Hello there. I am a dialog</p>\n      </Dialog>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nAdditional Features\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js includes additional features to improve the authoring experience of adding styles:\n\nWhen running locally with next dev, local stylesheets (either global or CSS modules) will take advantage of Fast Refresh to instantly reflect changes as edits are saved.\nWhen building for production with next build, CSS files will be bundled into fewer minified .css files to reduce the number of network requests needed to retrieve styles.\nIf you disable JavaScript, styles will still be loaded in the production build (next start). However, JavaScript is still required for next dev to enable Fast Refresh.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_styling_sass.txt","text":"Sass\nNext.js has built-in support for integrating with Sass after the package is installed using both the .scss and .sass extensions.

In React, a unit can be a single function, hook, or component.\n\nComponent testing is a more focused version of unit testing where the primary subject of the tests is React components. This may involve testing how components are rendered, their interaction with props, and their behavior in response to user events.\nIntegration testing involves testing how multiple units work together. This can be a combination of components, hooks, and functions.\n\n\nEnd-to-End (E2E) Testing involves testing user flows in an environment that simulates real user scenarios, like the browser. This means testing specific tasks (e.g. signup flow) in a production-like environment.\nSnapshot testing involves capturing the rendered output of a component and saving it to a snapshot file.

While you can still run unit tests for synchronous Server and Client Components, we recommend using an E2E tests for async components.\n\nQuickstart\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can use create-next-app with the Next.js with-jest example to quickly get started:\nTerminalnpx create-next-app@latest --example with-jest with-jest-app\nManual setup\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSince the release of Next.js 12, Next.js now has built-in configuration for Jest.\nTo set up Jest, install jest and the following packages as dev dependencies:\nTerminalnpm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom\n# or\nyarn add -D jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom\n# or\npnpm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom\nGenerate a basic Jest configuration file by running the following command:\nTerminalnpm init jest@latest\n# or\nyarn create jest@latest\n# or\npnpm create jest@latest\nThis will take you through a series of prompts to setup Jest for your project, including automatically creating a jest.config.ts|js file.\nUpdate your config file to use next/jest. This transformer has all the necessary configuration options for Jest to work with Next.js:\njest.config.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { Config } from 'jest'\nimport nextJest from 'next/jest.js'\n \nconst createJestConfig = nextJest({\n  // Provide the path to your Next.js app to load next.config.js and .env files in your test environment\n  dir: './',\n})\n \n// Add any custom config to be passed to Jest\nconst config: Config = {\n  coverageProvider: 'v8',\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  // Add more setup options before each test is run\n  // setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts'],\n}\n \n// createJestConfig is exported this way to ensure that next/jest can load the Next.js config which is async\nexport default createJestConfig(config)\n\nUnder the hood, next/jest is automatically configuring Jest for you, including:\n\nSetting up transform using the Next.js Compiler\nAuto mocking stylesheets (.css, .module.css, and their scss variants), image imports and next/font\nLoading .env (and all variants) into process.env\nIgnoring node_modules from test resolving and transforms\nIgnoring .next from test resolving\nLoading next.config.js for flags that enable SWC transforms\n\n\nGood to know: To test environment variables directly, load them manually in a separate setup script or in your jest.config.ts file. For more information, please see Test Environment Variables.\n\nSetting up Jest (with Babel)\n  \n    \n    \n  \nIf you opt out of the Next.js Compiler and use Babel instead, you will need to manually configure Jest and install babel-jest and identity-obj-proxy in addition to the packages above.Here are the recommended options to configure Jest for Next.js:jest.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  collectCoverage: true,\n  // on node 14.x coverage provider v8 offers good speed and more or less good report\n  coverageProvider: 'v8',\n  collectCoverageFrom: [\n    '**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',\n    '!**/*.d.ts',\n    '!**/node_modules/**',\n    '!<rootDir>/out/**',\n    '!<rootDir>/.next/**',\n    '!<rootDir>/*.config.js',\n    '!<rootDir>/coverage/**',\n  ],\n  moduleNameMapper: {\n    // Handle CSS imports (with CSS modules)\n    // https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack#mocking-css-modules\n    '^.+\\\\.module\\\\.(css|sass|scss)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',\n \n    // Handle CSS imports (without CSS modules)\n    '^.+\\\\.(css|sass|scss)$': '<rootDir>/__mocks__/styleMock.js',\n \n    // Handle image imports\n    // https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack#handling-static-assets\n    '^.+\\\\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp|avif|ico|bmp|svg)$/i': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js`,\n \n    // Handle module aliases\n    '^@/components/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/components/$1',\n \n    // Handle @next/font\n    '@next/font/(.*)': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/nextFontMock.js`,\n    // Handle next/font\n    'next/font/(.*)': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/nextFontMock.js`,\n    // Disable server-only\n    'server-only': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/empty.js`,\n  },\n  // Add more setup options before each test is run\n  // setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],\n  testPathIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/node_modules/', '<rootDir>/.next/'],\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  transform: {\n    // Use babel-jest to transpile tests with the next/babel preset\n    // https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object\n    '^.+\\\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$': ['babel-jest', { presets: ['next/babel'] }],\n  },\n  transformIgnorePatterns: [\n    '/node_modules/',\n    '^.+\\\\.module\\\\.(css|sass|scss)$',\n  ],\n}You can learn more about each configuration option in the Jest docs. We also recommend reviewing next/jest configuration to see how Next.js configures Jest.Handling stylesheets and image imports\n  \n    \n    \n  \nStylesheets and images aren't used in the tests but importing them may cause errors, so they will need to be mocked.Create the mock files referenced in the configuration above - fileMock.js and styleMock.js - inside a __mocks__ directory:__mocks__/fileMock.jsmodule.exports = 'test-file-stub'__mocks__/styleMock.jsmodule.exports = {}For more information on handling static assets, please refer to the Jest Docs.Handling Fonts\n  \n    \n    \n  \nTo handle fonts, create the nextFontMock.js file inside the __mocks__ directory, and add the following configuration:__mocks__/nextFontMock.jsmodule.exports = new Proxy(\n  {},\n  {\n    get: function getter() {\n      return () => ({\n        className: 'className',\n        variable: 'variable',\n        style: { fontFamily: 'fontFamily' },\n      })\n    },\n  }\n)\nOptional: Handling Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf your project is using Module Path Aliases, you will need to configure Jest to resolve the imports by matching the paths option in the jsconfig.json file with the moduleNameMapper option in the jest.config.js file. For example:\ntsconfig.json or jsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\njest.config.jsmoduleNameMapper: {\n  // ...\n  '^@/components/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/components/$1',\n}\nOptional: Extend Jest with custom matchers\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n@testing-library/jest-dom includes a set of convenient custom matchers such as .toBeInTheDocument() making it easier to write tests. You can import the custom matchers for every test by adding the following option to the Jest configuration file:\njest.config.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptsetupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts']\n\nThen, inside jest.setup.ts, add the following import:\njest.setup.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '@testing-library/jest-dom'\n\n\nGood to know:extend-expect was removed in v6.0, so if you are using @testing-library/jest-dom before version 6, you will need to import @testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect instead.\n\nIf you need to add more setup options before each test, you can add them to the jest.setup.js file above.\nAdd a test script to package.json:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFinally, add a Jest test script to your package.json file:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"test\": \"jest\",\n    \"test:watch\": \"jest --watch\"\n  }\n}\njest --watch will re-run tests when a file is changed. For more Jest CLI options, please refer to the Jest Docs.\nCreating your first test:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYour project is now ready to run tests. Create a folder called __tests__ in your project's root directory.\nFor example, we can add a test to check if the <Home /> component successfully renders a heading:export default function Home() {\n  return <h1>Home</h1>\n}__tests__/index.test.jsimport '@testing-library/jest-dom'\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Home from '../pages/index'\n \ndescribe('Home', () => {\n  it('renders a heading', () => {\n    render(<Home />)\n \n    const heading = screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })\n \n    expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\n\nOptionally, add a snapshot test to keep track of any unexpected changes in your component:\n__tests__/snapshot.jsimport { render } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Home from '../pages/index'\n \nit('renders homepage unchanged', () => {\n  const { container } = render(<Home />)\n  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot()\n})\nGood to know: Test files should not be included inside the Pages Router because any files inside the Pages Router are considered routes.\n\n\nRunning your tests\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThen, run the following command to run your tests:\nTerminalnpm run test\n# or\nyarn test\n# or\npnpm test\nAdditional Resources\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nFor further reading, you may find these resources helpful:\n\nNext.js with Jest example\nJest Docs\nReact Testing Library Docs\nTesting Playground - use good testing practices to match elements.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_testing_playwright.txt","text":"Setting up Playwright with Next.jsPlaywright is a testing framework that lets you automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API.

The new Router is available in the app directory and co-exists with the pages directory.\nUpgrading to Next.js 13 does not require using the new App Router. You can continue using pages with new features that work in both directories, such as the updated Image component, Link component, Script component, and Font optimization.\n<Image/> Component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js 12 introduced new improvements to the Image Component with a temporary import: next/future/image. These improvements included less client-side JavaScript, easier ways to extend and style images, better accessibility, and native browser lazy loading.\nIn version 13, this new behavior is now the default for next/image.\nThere are two codemods to help you migrate to the new Image Component:\n\nnext-image-to-legacy-image codemod: Safely and automatically renames next/image imports to next/legacy/image. Existing components will maintain the same behavior.\nnext-image-experimental codemod: Dangerously adds inline styles and removes unused props. This will change the behavior of existing components to match the new defaults. To use this codemod, you need to run the next-image-to-legacy-image codemod first.\n\n<Link> Component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe <Link> Component no longer requires manually adding an <a> tag as a child. This behavior was added as an experimental option in version 12.2 and is now the default. In Next.js 13, <Link> always renders <a> and allows you to forward props to the underlying tag.\nFor example:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \n// Next.js 12: `<a>` has to be nested otherwise it's excluded\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a>About</a>\n</Link>\n \n// Next.js 13: `<Link>` always renders `<a>` under the hood\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  About\n</Link>\nTo upgrade your links to Next.js 13, you can use the new-link codemod.\n<Script> Component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe behavior of next/script has been updated to support both pages and app, but some changes need to be made to ensure a smooth migration:\n\nMove any beforeInteractive scripts you previously included in _document.js to the root layout file (app/layout.tsx).\nThe experimental worker strategy does not yet work in app and scripts denoted with this strategy will either have to be removed or modified to use a different strategy (e.g. lazyOnload).\nonLoad, onReady, and onError handlers will not work in Server Components so make sure to move them to a Client Component or remove them altogether.\n\nFont Optimization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPreviously, Next.js helped you optimize fonts by inlining font CSS. Version 13 introduces the new next/font module which gives you the ability to customize your font loading experience while still ensuring great performance and privacy. next/font is supported in both the pages and app directories.\nWhile inlining CSS still works in pages, it does not work in app. You should use next/font instead.\nSee the Font Optimization page to learn how to use next/font.\nMigrating from pages to app\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n🎥 Watch: Learn how to incrementally adopt the App Router → YouTube (16 minutes).\n\nMoving to the App Router may be the first time using React features that Next.js builds on top of such as Server Components, Suspense, and more. When combined with new Next.js features such as special files and layouts, migration means new concepts, mental models, and behavioral changes to learn.\nWe recommend reducing the combined complexity of these updates by breaking down your migration into smaller steps. The app directory is intentionally designed to work simultaneously with the pages directory to allow for incremental page-by-page migration.\n\nThe app directory supports nested routes and layouts. Learn more.\nUse nested folders to define routes and a special page.js file to make a route segment publicly accessible. Learn more.\nSpecial file conventions are used to create UI for each route segment. The most common special files are page.js and layout.js.\n\nUse page.js to define UI unique to a route.\nUse layout.js to define UI that is shared across multiple routes.\n.js, .jsx, or .tsx file extensions can be used for special files.\n\n\nYou can colocate other files inside the app directory such as components, styles, tests, and more. Learn more.\nData fetching functions like getServerSideProps and getStaticProps have been replaced with a new API inside app. getStaticPaths has been replaced with generateStaticParams.\npages/_app.js and pages/_document.js have been replaced with a single app/layout.js root layout. Learn more.\npages/_error.js has been replaced with more granular error.js special files. Learn more.\npages/404.js has been replaced with the not-found.js file.\npages/api/* API Routes have been replaced with the route.js (Route Handler) special file.\n\nStep 1: Creating the app directory\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nUpdate to the latest Next.js version (requires 13.4 or greater):\nnpm install next@latest\nThen, create a new app directory at the root of your project (or src/ directory).\nStep 2: Creating a Root Layout\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCreate a new app/layout.tsx file inside the app directory. This is a root layout that will apply to all routes inside app.\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  // Layouts must accept a children prop.\n  // This will be populated with nested layouts or pages\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nThe app directory must include a root layout.\nThe root layout must define <html>, and <body> tags since Next.js does not automatically create them\nThe root layout replaces the pages/_app.tsx and pages/_document.tsx files.\n.js, .jsx, or .tsx extensions can be used for layout files.\n\nTo manage <head> HTML elements, you can use the built-in SEO support:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Home',\n  description: 'Welcome to Next.js',\n}\n\nMigrating _document.js and _app.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you have an existing _app or _document file, you can copy the contents (e.g. global styles) to the root layout (app/layout.tsx). Styles in app/layout.tsx will not apply to pages/*. You should keep _app/_document while migrating to prevent your pages/* routes from breaking. Once fully migrated, you can then safely delete them.\nIf you are using any React Context providers, they will need to be moved to a Client Component.\nMigrating the getLayout() pattern to Layouts (Optional)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js recommended adding a property to Page components to achieve per-page layouts in the pages directory. This pattern can be replaced with native support for nested layouts in the app directory.\nSee before and after exampleBeforecomponents/DashboardLayout.jsexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>My Dashboard</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}pages/dashboard/index.jsimport DashboardLayout from '../components/DashboardLayout'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <p>My Page</p>\n}\n \nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {\n  return <DashboardLayout>{page}</DashboardLayout>\n}After\n\nRemove the Page.getLayout property from pages/dashboard/index.js and follow the steps for migrating pages to the app directory.\napp/dashboard/page.jsexport default function Page() {\n  return <p>My Page</p>\n}\n\n\nMove the contents of DashboardLayout into a new Client Component to retain pages directory behavior.\napp/dashboard/DashboardLayout.js'use client' // this directive should be at top of the file, before any imports.\n \n// This is a Client Component\nexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>My Dashboard</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\n\nImport the DashboardLayout into a new layout.js file inside the app directory.\napp/dashboard/layout.jsimport DashboardLayout from './DashboardLayout'\n \n// This is a Server Component\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return <DashboardLayout>{children}</DashboardLayout>\n}\n\n\nYou can incrementally move non-interactive parts of DashboardLayout.js (Client Component) into layout.js (Server Component) to reduce the amount of component JavaScript you send to the client.\n\n\nStep 3: Migrating next/head\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, the next/head React component is used to manage <head> HTML elements such as title and meta . In the app directory, next/head is replaced with the new built-in SEO support.\nBefore:\npages/index.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Head from 'next/head'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>My page title</title>\n      </Head>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nAfter:\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'My Page Title',\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...'\n}\n\nSee all metadata options.\nStep 4: Migrating Pages\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nPages in the app directory are Server Components by default. This is different from the pages directory where pages are Client Components.\nData fetching has changed in app. getServerSideProps, getStaticProps and getInitialProps have been replaced with a simpler API.\nThe app directory uses nested folders to define routes and a special page.js file to make a route segment publicly accessible.\n\npages Directoryapp DirectoryRouteindex.jspage.js/about.jsabout/page.js/aboutblog/[slug].jsblog/[slug]/page.js/blog/post-1\n\n\nWe recommend breaking down the migration of a page into two main steps:\n\nStep 1: Move the default exported Page Component into a new Client Component.\nStep 2: Import the new Client Component into a new page.js file inside the app directory.\n\n\nGood to know: This is the easiest migration path because it has the most comparable behavior to the pages directory.\n\nStep 1: Create a new Client Component\n\nCreate a new separate file inside the app directory (i.e. app/home-page.tsx or similar) that exports a Client Component. To define Client Components, add the 'use client' directive to the top of the file (before any imports).\n\nSimilar to the Pages Router, there is an optimization step to prerender Client Components to static HTML on the initial page load.\n\n\nMove the default exported page component from pages/index.js to app/home-page.tsx.\n\napp/home-page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \n// This is a Client Component (same as components in the `pages` directory)\n// It receives data as props, has access to state and effects, and is\n// prerendered on the server during the initial page load.\nexport default function HomePage({ recentPosts }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {recentPosts.map((post) => (\n        <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nStep 2: Create a new page\n\n\nCreate a new app/page.tsx file inside the app directory. This is a Server Component by default.\n\n\nImport the home-page.tsx Client Component into the page.\n\n\nIf you were fetching data in pages/index.js, move the data fetching logic directly into the Server Component using the new data fetching APIs. See the data fetching upgrade guide for more details.\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// Import your Client Component\nimport HomePage from './home-page'\n \nasync function getPosts() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n  return posts\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  // Fetch data directly in a Server Component\n  const recentPosts = await getPosts()\n  // Forward fetched data to your Client Component\n  return <HomePage recentPosts={recentPosts} />\n}\n\n\n\nIf your previous page used useRouter, you'll need to update to the new routing hooks. Learn more.\n\n\nStart your development server and visit http://localhost:3000. You should see your existing index route, now served through the app directory.\n\n\nStep 5: Migrating Routing Hooks\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA new router has been added to support the new behavior in the app directory.\nIn app, you should use the three new hooks imported from next/navigation: useRouter(), usePathname(), and useSearchParams().\n\nThe new useRouter hook is imported from next/navigation and has different behavior to the useRouter hook in pages which is imported from next/router.\n\nThe useRouter hook imported from next/router is not supported in the app directory but can continue to be used in the pages directory.\n\n\nThe new useRouter does not return the pathname string. Use the separate usePathname hook instead.\nThe new useRouter does not return the query object. Use the separate useSearchParams hook instead.\nYou can use useSearchParams and usePathname together to listen to page changes. See the Router Events section for more details.\nThese new hooks are only supported in Client Components. They cannot be used in Server Components.\n\napp/example-client-component.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport { useRouter, usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function ExampleClientComponent() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  // ...\n}\n\nIn addition, the new useRouter hook has the following changes:\n\nisFallback has been removed because fallback has been replaced.\nThe locale, locales, defaultLocales, domainLocales values have been removed because built-in i18n Next.js features are no longer necessary in the app directory. Learn more about i18n.\nbasePath has been removed. The alternative will not be part of useRouter. It has not yet been implemented.\nasPath has been removed because the concept of as has been removed from the new router.\nisReady has been removed because it is no longer necessary. During static rendering, any component that uses the useSearchParams() hook will skip the prerendering step and instead be rendered on the client at runtime.\n\nView the useRouter() API reference.\nStep 6: Migrating Data Fetching Methods\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe pages directory uses getServerSideProps and getStaticProps to fetch data for pages. Inside the app directory, these previous data fetching functions are replaced with a simpler API built on top of fetch() and async React Server Components.\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default async function Page() {\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\n \n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n \n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  })\n \n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n\nServer-side Rendering (getServerSideProps)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, getServerSideProps is used to fetch data on the server and forward props to the default exported React component in the file. The initial HTML for the page is prerendered from the server, followed by \"hydrating\" the page in the browser (making it interactive).\npages/dashboard.js// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n \nexport default function Dashboard({ projects }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\nIn the app directory, we can colocate our data fetching inside our React components using Server Components. This allows us to send less JavaScript to the client, while maintaining the rendered HTML from the server.\nBy setting the cache option to no-store, we can indicate that the fetched data should never be cached. This is similar to getServerSideProps in the pages directory.\napp/dashboard/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// `app` directory\n \n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return projects\n}\n \nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n \n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n\nAccessing Request Object\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, you can retrieve request-based data based on the Node.js HTTP API.\nFor example, you can retrieve the req object from getServerSideProps and use it to retrieve the request's cookies and headers.\npages/index.js// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getServerSideProps({ req, query }) {\n  const authHeader = req.getHeaders()['authorization'];\n  const theme = req.cookies['theme'];\n \n  return { props: { ... }}\n}\n \nexport default function Page(props) {\n  return ...\n}\nThe app directory exposes new read-only functions to retrieve request data:\n\nheaders(): Based on the Web Headers API, and can be used inside Server Components to retrieve request headers.\ncookies(): Based on the Web Cookies API, and can be used inside Server Components to retrieve cookies.\n\napp/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript// `app` directory\nimport { cookies, headers } from 'next/headers'\n \nasync function getData() {\n  const authHeader = headers().get('authorization')\n \n  return '...'\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  // You can use `cookies()` or `headers()` inside Server Components\n  // directly or in your data fetching function\n  const theme = cookies().get('theme')\n  const data = await getData()\n  return '...'\n}\n\nStatic Site Generation (getStaticProps)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, the getStaticProps function is used to pre-render a page at build time. This function can be used to fetch data from an external API or directly from a database, and pass this data down to the entire page as it's being generated during the build.\npages/index.js// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n \nexport default function Index({ projects }) {\n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\n}\nIn the app directory, data fetching with fetch() will default to cache: 'force-cache', which will cache the request data until manually invalidated. This is similar to getStaticProps in the pages directory.\napp/page.js// `app` directory\n \n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return projects\n}\n \nexport default async function Index() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n \n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\n}\nDynamic paths (getStaticPaths)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, the getStaticPaths function is used to define the dynamic paths that should be pre-rendered at build time.\npages/posts/[id].js// `pages` directory\nimport PostLayout from '@/components/post-layout'\n \nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [{ params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }],\n  }\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n \nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return <PostLayout post={post} />\n}\nIn the app directory, getStaticPaths is replaced with generateStaticParams.\ngenerateStaticParams behaves similarly to getStaticPaths, but has a simplified API for returning route parameters and can be used inside layouts. The return shape of generateStaticParams is an array of segments instead of an array of nested param objects or a string of resolved paths.\napp/posts/[id]/page.js// `app` directory\nimport PostLayout from '@/components/post-layout'\n \nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ id: '1' }, { id: '2' }]\n}\n \nasync function getPost(params) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  return post\n}\n \nexport default async function Post({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params)\n \n  return <PostLayout post={post} />\n}\nUsing the name generateStaticParams is more appropriate than getStaticPaths for the new model in the app directory. The get prefix is replaced with a more descriptive generate, which sits better alone now that getStaticProps and getServerSideProps are no longer necessary. The Paths suffix is replaced by Params, which is more appropriate for nested routing with multiple dynamic segments.\n\nReplacing fallback\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, the fallback property returned from getStaticPaths is used to define the behavior of a page that isn't pre-rendered at build time. This property can be set to true to show a fallback page while the page is being generated, false to show a 404 page, or blocking to generate the page at request time.\npages/posts/[id].js// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [],\n    fallback: 'blocking'\n  };\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  ...\n}\n \nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return ...\n}\nIn the app directory the config.dynamicParams property controls how params outside of generateStaticParams are handled:\n\ntrue: (default) Dynamic segments not included in generateStaticParams are generated on demand.\nfalse: Dynamic segments not included in generateStaticParams will return a 404.\n\nThis replaces the fallback: true | false | 'blocking' option of getStaticPaths in the pages directory. The fallback: 'blocking' option is not included in dynamicParams because the difference between 'blocking' and true is negligible with streaming.\napp/posts/[id]/page.js// `app` directory\n \nexport const dynamicParams = true;\n \nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [...]\n}\n \nasync function getPost(params) {\n  ...\n}\n \nexport default async function Post({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params);\n \n  return ...\n}\nWith dynamicParams set to true (the default), when a route segment is requested that hasn't been generated, it will be server-rendered and cached.\nIncremental Static Regeneration (getStaticProps with revalidate)\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, the getStaticProps function allows you to add a revalidate field to automatically regenerate a page after a certain amount of time.\npages/index.js// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`)\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  return {\n    props: { posts },\n    revalidate: 60,\n  }\n}\n \nexport default function Index({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <PostList posts={posts} />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\nIn the app directory, data fetching with fetch() can use revalidate, which will cache the request for the specified amount of seconds.\napp/page.js// `app` directory\n \nasync function getPosts() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`, { next: { revalidate: 60 } })\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  return data.posts\n}\n \nexport default async function PostList() {\n  const posts = await getPosts()\n \n  return posts.map((post) => <div>{post.name}</div>)\n}\nAPI Routes\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAPI Routes continue to work in the pages/api directory without any changes. However, they have been replaced by Route Handlers in the app directory.\nRoute Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web Request and Response APIs.\napp/api/route.tsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport async function GET(request: Request) {}\n\n\nGood to know: If you previously used API routes to call an external API from the client, you can now use Server Components instead to securely fetch data. Learn more about data fetching.\n\nStep 7: Styling\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn the pages directory, global stylesheets are restricted to only pages/_app.js. With the app directory, this restriction has been lifted. Global styles can be added to any layout, page, or component.\n\nCSS Modules\nTailwind CSS\nGlobal Styles\nCSS-in-JS\nExternal Stylesheets\nSass\n\nTailwind CSS\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you're using Tailwind CSS, you'll need to add the app directory to your tailwind.config.js file:\ntailwind.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}', // <-- Add this line\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n  ],\n}\nYou'll also need to import your global styles in your app/layout.js file:\napp/layout.jsimport '../styles/globals.css'\n \nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\nLearn more about styling with Tailwind CSS\nCodemods\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js provides Codemod transformations to help upgrade your codebase when a feature is deprecated.

Client-side only applications, also known as single-page applications (SPAs), often experience slow initial page loading time. This happens due to a couple of reasons:\n\nThe browser needs to wait for the React code and your entire application bundle to download and run before your code is able to send requests to load data.\nYour application code grows with every new feature and dependency you add.\n\nNo automatic code splitting\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe previous issue of slow loading times can be somewhat managed with code splitting. However, if you try to do code splitting manually, you'll often make performance worse. It's easy to inadvertently introduce network waterfalls when code-splitting manually. Next.js provides automatic code splitting built into its router.\nNetwork waterfalls\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA common cause of poor performance occurs when applications make sequential client-server requests to fetch data. One common pattern for data fetching in an SPA is to initially render a placeholder, and then fetch data after the component has mounted. Unfortunately, this means that a child component that fetches data can't start fetching until the parent component has finished loading its own data.\nWhile fetching data on the client is supported with Next.js, it also gives you the option to shift data fetching to the server, which can eliminate client-server waterfalls.\nFast and intentional loading states\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWith built-in support for streaming through React Suspense, you can be more intentional about which parts of your UI you want to load first and in what order without introducing network waterfalls.\nThis enables you to build pages that are faster to load and eliminate layout shifts.\nChoose the data fetching strategy\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDepending on your needs, Next.js allows you to choose your data fetching strategy on a page and component basis. You can decide to fetch at build time, at request time on the server, or on the client. For example, you can fetch data from your CMS and render your blog posts at build time, which can then be efficiently cached on a CDN.\nMiddleware\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js Middleware allows you to run code on the server before a request is completed. This is especially useful to avoid having a flash of unauthenticated content when the user visits an authenticated-only page by redirecting the user to a login page. The middleware is also useful for experimentation and internationalization.\nBuilt-in Optimizations\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nImages, fonts, and third-party scripts often have significant impact on an application's performance. Next.js comes with built-in components that automatically optimize those for you.\nMigration Steps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOur goal with this migration is to get a working Next.js application as quickly as possible, so that you can then adopt Next.js features incrementally. To begin with, we'll keep it as a purely client-side application (SPA) without migrating your existing router. This helps minimize the chances of encountering issues during the migration process and reduces merge conflicts.\nStep 1: Install the Next.js Dependency\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe first thing you need to do is to install next as a dependency:\nTerminalnpm install next@latest\nStep 2: Create the Next.js Configuration File\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCreate a next.config.mjs at the root of your project. This file will hold your Next.js configuration options.\nnext.config.mjs/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './dist', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist/`.\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\nStep 3: Update TypeScript Configuration\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you're using TypeScript, you need to update your tsconfig.json file with the following changes to make it compatible with Next.js:\ntsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"dom.iterable\", \"esnext\"],\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"strict\": false,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"plugins\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"next\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.tsx\",\n    \".next/types/**/*.ts\",\n    \"./dist/types/**/*.ts\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\nYou can find more information about configuring TypeScript on the Next.js docs.\nStep 4: Create the Root Layout\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA Next.js App Router application must include a root layout file, which is a React Server Component that will wrap all pages in your application. This file is defined at the top level of the app directory.\nThe closest equivalent to the root layout file in a CRA application is the index.html file, which contains your <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.\nIn this step, you'll convert your index.html file into a root layout file:\n\nCreate a new app directory in your src directory.\nCreate a new layout.tsx file inside that app directory:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return null\n}\n\n\nGood to know: .js, .jsx, or .tsx extensions can be used for Layout files.\n\nCopy the content of your index.html file into the previously created <RootLayout> component while replacing the body.div#root and body.script tags with <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nGood to know: We'll ignore the manifest file, additional iconography other than the favicon, and testing configuration, but if these are requirements, Next.js also supports these options.\n\nStep 5: Metadata\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js already includes by default the meta charset and meta viewport tags, so you can safely remove those from your <head>:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nAny metadata files such as favicon.ico, icon.png, robots.txt are automatically added to the application <head> tag as long as you have them placed into the top level of the app directory. After moving all supported files into the app directory you can safely delete their <link> tags:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nFinally, Next.js can manage your last <head> tags with the Metadata API. Move your final metadata info into an exported metadata object:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'React App',\n  description: 'Web site created with Next.js.',\n}\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nWith the above changes, you shifted from declaring everything in your index.html to using Next.js' convention-based approach built into the framework (Metadata API). This approach enables you to more easily improve your SEO and web shareability of your pages.\nStep 6: Styles\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nLike Create React App, Next.js has built-in support for CSS Modules.\nIf you're using a global CSS file, import it into your app/layout.tsx file:\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '../index.css'\n \n// ...\nIf you're using Tailwind, you'll need to install postcss and autoprefixer:\nTerminalnpm install postcss autoprefixer\nThen, create a postcss.config.js file at the root of your project:\npostcss.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss: {},\n    autoprefixer: {},\n  },\n}\nStep 7: Create the Entrypoint Page\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOn Next.js you declare an entrypoint for your application by creating a page.tsx file. The closest equivalent of this file on CRA is your src/index.tsx file. In this step, you’ll set up the entry point of your application.\nCreate a [[...slug]] directory in your app directory.\nSince this guide is aiming to first set up our Next.js as an SPA (Single Page Application), you need your page entry point to catch all possible routes of your application. For that, create a new [[...slug]] directory in your app directory.\nThis directory is what is called an optional catch-all route segment. Next.js uses a file-system based router where directories are used to define routes. This special directory will make sure that all routes of your application will be directed to its containing page.tsx file.\nCreate a new page.tsx file inside the app/[[...slug]] directory with the following content:\napp/[[...slug]]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '../../index.css'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n\nThis file is a Server Component. When you run next build, the file is prerendered into a static asset. It does not require any dynamic code.\nThis file imports our global CSS and tells generateStaticParams we are only going to generate one route, the index route at /.\nNow, let's move the rest of our CRA application which will run client-only.\napp/[[...slug]]/client.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport React from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n \nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n\nThis file is a Client Component, defined by the 'use client' directive. Client Components are still prerendered to HTML on the server before being sent to the client.\nSince we want a client-only application to start, we can configure Next.js to disable prerendering from the App component down.\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\nNow, update your entrypoint page to use the new component:\napp/[[...slug]]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '../../index.css'\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n\nStep 8: Update Static Image Imports\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js handles static image imports slightly different from CRA. With CRA, importing an image file will return its public URL as a string:\nApp.tsximport image from './img.png'\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return <img src={image} />\n}\nWith Next.js, static image imports return an object. The object can then be used directly with the Next.js <Image> component, or you can use the object's src property with your existing <img> tag.\nThe <Image> component has the added benefits of automatic image optimization. The <Image> component automatically sets the width and height attributes of the resulting <img> based on the image's dimensions. This prevents layout shifts when the image loads. However, this can cause issues if your app contains images with only one of their dimensions being styled without the other styled to auto. When not styled to auto, the dimension will default to the <img> dimension attribute's value, which can cause the image to appear distorted.\nKeeping the <img> tag will reduce the amount of changes in your application and prevent the above issues. You can then optionally later migrate to the <Image> component to take advantage of optimizing images by configuring a loader, or moving to the default Next.js server which has automatic image optimization.\nConvert absolute import paths for images imported from /public into relative imports:\n// Before\nimport logo from '/logo.png'\n \n// After\nimport logo from '../public/logo.png'\nPass the image src property instead of the whole image object to your <img> tag:\n// Before\n<img src={logo} />\n \n// After\n<img src={logo.src} />\nAlternatively, you can reference the public URL for the image asset based on the filename. For example, public/logo.png will serve the image at /logo.png for your application, which would be the src value.\n\nWarning: If you're using TypeScript, you might encounter type errors when accessing the src property. You can safely ignore those for now. They will be fixed by the end of this guide.\n\nStep 9: Migrate the Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has support for .env environment variables similar to CRA.\nThe main difference is the prefix used to expose environment variables on the client-side. Change all environment variables with the REACT_APP_ prefix to NEXT_PUBLIC_.\nStep 10: Update Scripts in package.json\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou should now be able to run your application to test if you successfully migrated to Next.js. But before that, you need to update your scripts in your package.json with Next.js related commands, and add .next, next-env.d.ts, and dist to your .gitignore file:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n.gitignore# ...\n.next\nnext-env.d.ts\ndist\nNow run npm run dev, and open http://localhost:3000. You should see your application now running on Next.js.\nStep 11: Clean Up\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can now clean up your codebase from Create React App related artifacts:\n\nDelete src/index.tsx\nDelete public/index.html\nDelete reportWebVitals setup\nUninstall CRA dependencies (react-scripts)\n\nBundler Compatibility\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nCreate React App and Next.js both default to using webpack for bundling.\nWhen migrating your CRA application to Next.js, you might have a custom webpack configuration you're looking to migrate. Next.js supports providing a custom webpack configuration.\nFurther, Next.js has support for Turbopack through next dev --turbo to improve your local dev performance. Turbopack supports some webpack loaders as well for compatibility and incremental adoption.\nNext Steps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf everything went according to plan, you now have a functioning Next.js application running as a single-page application. However, you aren't yet taking advantage of most of Next.js' benefits, but you can now start making incremental changes to reap all the benefits. Here's what you might want to do next:\n\nMigrate from React Router to the Next.js App Router to get:\n\nAutomatic code splitting\nStreaming Server-Rendering\nReact Server Components\n\n\nOptimize images with the <Image> component\nOptimize fonts with next/font\nOptimize third-party scripts with the <Script> component\nUpdate your ESLint configuration to support Next.js rules\n\n\nGood to know: Using a static export does not currently support using the useParams hook.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_upgrading_from-vite.txt","text":"Migrating from ViteThis guide will help you migrate an existing Vite application to Next.js.\nWhy Switch?\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are several reasons why you might want to switch from Vite to Next.js:\nSlow initial page loading time\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you have built your application with the default Vite plugin for React, your application is a purely client-side application.

If you're not using TypeScript, you can skip this step.\n\nRemove the project reference to tsconfig.node.json\nAdd ./dist/types/**/*.ts and ./next-env.d.ts to the include array\nAdd ./node_modules to the exclude array\nAdd { \"name\": \"next\" } to the plugins array in compilerOptions: \"plugins\": [{ \"name\": \"next\" }]\nSet esModuleInterop to true: \"esModuleInterop\": true\nSet jsx to preserve: \"jsx\": \"preserve\"\nSet allowJs to true: \"allowJs\": true\nSet forceConsistentCasingInFileNames to true: \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true\nSet incremental to true: \"incremental\": true\n\nHere's an example of a working tsconfig.json with those changes:\ntsconfig.json{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"ES2020\",\n    \"useDefineForClassFields\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"ES2020\", \"DOM\", \"DOM.Iterable\"],\n    \"module\": \"ESNext\",\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"allowImportingTsExtensions\": true,\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noUnusedLocals\": true,\n    \"noUnusedParameters\": true,\n    \"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch\": true,\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"plugins\": [{ \"name\": \"next\" }]\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"./src\", \"./dist/types/**/*.ts\", \"./next-env.d.ts\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"./node_modules\"]\n}\nYou can find more information about configuring TypeScript on the\nNext.js docs.\nStep 4: Create the Root Layout\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nA Next.js App Router application must include a\nroot layout\nfile, which is a React Server Component\nthat will wrap all pages in your application. This file is defined at the top level of the app\ndirectory.\nThe closest equivalent to the root layout file in a Vite application is the\nindex.html file, which contains your\n<html>, <head>, and <body> tags.\nIn this step, you'll convert your index.html file into a root layout file:\n\nCreate a new app directory in your src directory.\nCreate a new layout.tsx file inside that app directory:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return null\n}\n\n\nGood to know: .js, .jsx, or .tsx extensions can be used for Layout files.\n\n\nCopy the content of your index.html file into the previously created <RootLayout> component while\nreplacing the body.div#root and body.script tags with <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/icon.svg\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nNext.js already includes by default the\nmeta charset and\nmeta viewport tags, so you\ncan safely remove those from your <head>:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/icon.svg\" />\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nAny metadata files\nsuch as favicon.ico, icon.png, robots.txt are automatically added to the application\n<head> tag as long as you have them placed into the top level of the app directory. After\nmoving\nall supported files\ninto the app directory you can safely delete their <link> tags:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\n\nFinally, Next.js can manage your last <head> tags with the\nMetadata API. Move your final metadata\ninfo into an exported\nmetadata object:\n\napp/layout.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'My App',\n  description: 'My App is a...',\n}\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nWith the above changes, you shifted from declaring everything in your index.html to using Next.js'\nconvention-based approach built into the framework\n(Metadata API). This approach enables you\nto more easily improve your SEO and web shareability of your pages.\nStep 5: Create the Entrypoint Page\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOn Next.js you declare an entrypoint for your application by creating a page.tsx file. The\nclosest equivalent of this file on Vite is your main.tsx file. In this step, you’ll set up the\nentrypoint of your application.\n\nCreate a [[...slug]] directory in your app directory.\n\nSince in this guide we're aiming first to set up our Next.js as an SPA (Single Page Application),\nyou need your page entrypoint to catch all possible routes of your application. For that, create a\nnew [[...slug]] directory in your app directory.\nThis directory is what is called an\noptional catch-all route segment.\nNext.js uses a file-system based router where\ndirectories are used to define routes.\nThis special directory will make sure that all routes of your application will be directed to its\ncontaining page.tsx file.\n\nCreate a new page.tsx file inside the app/[[...slug]] directory with the following content:\n\napp/[[...slug]]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '../../index.css'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n\n\nGood to know: .js, .jsx, or .tsx extensions can be used for Page files.\n\nThis file is a Server Component. When you run next build, the file is prerendered into a static asset. It does not require any dynamic code.\nThis file imports our global CSS and tells generateStaticParams we are only going to generate one route, the index route at /.\nNow, let's move the rest of our Vite application which will run client-only.\napp/[[...slug]]/client.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client'\n \nimport React from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n \nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n\nThis file is a Client Component, defined by the 'use client'\ndirective. Client Components are still prerendered to HTML on the server before being sent to the client.\nSince we want a client-only application to start, we can configure Next.js to disable prerendering from the App component down.\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\nNow, update your entrypoint page to use the new component:\napp/[[...slug]]/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport '../../index.css'\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n\nStep 6: Update Static Image Imports\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js handles static image imports slightly different from Vite. With Vite, importing an image\nfile will return its public URL as a string:\nApp.tsximport image from './img.png' // `image` will be '/assets/img.2d8efhg.png' in production\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return <img src={image} />\n}\nWith Next.js, static image imports return an object. The object can then be used directly with the\nNext.js <Image> component, or you can use the object's\nsrc property with your existing <img> tag.\nThe <Image> component has the added benefits of\nautomatic image optimization. The <Image>\ncomponent automatically sets the width and height attributes of the resulting <img> based on\nthe image's dimensions. This prevents layout shifts when the image loads. However, this can cause\nissues if your app contains images with only one of their dimensions being styled without the other\nstyled to auto. When not styled to auto, the dimension will default to the <img> dimension\nattribute's value, which can cause the image to appear distorted.\nKeeping the <img> tag will reduce the amount of changes in your application and prevent the above\nissues. You can then optionally later migrate to the <Image> component to take advantage of optimizing images by configuring a loader, or moving to the default Next.js server which has automatic image optimization.\n\nConvert absolute import paths for images imported from /public into relative imports:\n\n// Before\nimport logo from '/logo.png'\n \n// After\nimport logo from '../public/logo.png'\n\nPass the image src property instead of the whole image object to your <img> tag:\n\n// Before\n<img src={logo} />\n \n// After\n<img src={logo.src} />\nAlternatively, you can reference the public URL for the image asset based on the filename. For example, public/logo.png will serve the image at /logo.png for your application, which would be the src value.\n\nWarning: If you're using TypeScript, you might encounter type errors when accessing the src\nproperty. You can safely ignore those for now. They will be fixed by the end of this guide.\n\nStep 7: Migrate the Environment Variables\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js has support for .env\nenvironment variables\nsimilar to Vite. The main difference is the prefix used to expose environment variables on the\nclient-side.\n\nChange all environment variables with the VITE_ prefix to NEXT_PUBLIC_.\n\nVite exposes a few built-in environment variables on the special import.meta.env object which\naren’t supported by Next.js. You need to update their usage as follows:\n\nimport.meta.env.MODE ⇒ process.env.NODE_ENV\nimport.meta.env.PROD ⇒ process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'\nimport.meta.env.DEV ⇒ process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'\nimport.meta.env.SSR ⇒ typeof window !== 'undefined'\n\nNext.js also doesn't provide a built-in BASE_URL environment variable. However, you can still\nconfigure one, if you need it:\n\nAdd the following to your .env file:\n\n.env# ...\nNEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=\"/some-base-path\"\n\nSet basePath to process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH in your next.config.mjs file:\n\nnext.config.mjs/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './dist', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist/`.\n  basePath: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH, // Sets the base path to `/some-base-path`.\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nUpdate import.meta.env.BASE_URL usages to process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH\n\nStep 8: Update Scripts in package.json\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou should now be able to run your application to test if you successfully migrated to Next.js. But\nbefore that, you need to update your scripts in your package.json with Next.js related commands,\nand add .next and next-env.d.ts to your .gitignore:\npackage.json{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n.gitignore# ...\n.next\nnext-env.d.ts\ndist\nNow run npm run dev, and open http://localhost:3000. You should see your application now running on Next.js.\n\nExample: Check out this pull request for a\nworking example of a Vite application migrated to Next.js.\n\nStep 9: Clean Up\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can now clean up your codebase from Vite related artifacts:\n\nDelete main.tsx\nDelete index.html\nDelete vite-env.d.ts\nDelete tsconfig.node.json\nDelete vite.config.ts\nUninstall Vite dependencies\n\nNext Steps\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf everything went according to plan, you now have a functioning Next.js application running as a\nsingle-page application. However, you aren't yet taking advantage of most of Next.js' benefits, but\nyou can now start making incremental changes to reap all the benefits. Here's what you might want to\ndo next:\n\nMigrate from React Router to the Next.js App Router to get:\n\nAutomatic code splitting\nStreaming Server-Rendering\nReact Server Components\n\n\nOptimize images with the <Image> component\nOptimize fonts with next/font\nOptimize third-party scripts with the <Script> component\nUpdate your ESLint configuration to support Next.js rules\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_upgrading_version-10.txt","text":"Version 10There were no breaking changes between versions 9 and 10.\nTo upgrade to version 10, run the following command:\nTerminalnpm i next@10\nTerminalyarn add next@10\nTerminalpnpm up next@10\nTerminalbun add next@10\n\nGood to know: If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade @types/react and @types/react-dom to their corresponding versions.\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_upgrading_version-11.txt","text":"Version 11To upgrade to version 11, run the following command:\nTerminalnpm i next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\nTerminalyarn add next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\nTerminalpnpm up next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\nTerminalbun add next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\n\nGood to know: If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade @types/react and @types/react-dom to their corresponding versions.\n\nWebpack 5\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nWebpack 5 is now the default for all Next.js applications. If you did not have a custom webpack configuration, your application is already using webpack 5. If you do have a custom webpack configuration, you can refer to the Next.js webpack 5 documentation for upgrade guidance.\nCleaning the distDir is now a default\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe build output directory (defaults to .next) is now cleared by default except for the Next.js caches. You can refer to the cleaning distDir RFC for more information.\nIf your application was relying on this behavior previously you can disable the new default behavior by adding the cleanDistDir: false flag in next.config.js.\nPORT is now supported for next dev and next start\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js 11 supports the PORT environment variable to set the port the application runs on. Using -p/--port is still recommended but if you were prohibited from using -p in any way you can now use PORT as an alternative:\nExample:\nPORT=4000 next start\n\nnext.config.js customization to import images\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js 11 supports static image imports with next/image. This new feature relies on being able to process image imports. If you previously added the next-images or next-optimized-images packages you can either move to the new built-in support using next/image or disable the feature:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\nRemove super.componentDidCatch() from pages/_app.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe next/app component's componentDidCatch was deprecated in Next.js 9 as it's no longer needed and has since been a no-op. In Next.js 11, it was removed.\nIf your pages/_app.js has a custom componentDidCatch method you can remove super.componentDidCatch as it is no longer needed.\nRemove Container from pages/_app.js\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis export was deprecated in Next.js 9 as it's no longer needed and has since been a no-op with a warning during development. In Next.js 11 it was removed.\nIf your pages/_app.js imports Container from next/app you can remove Container as it was removed. Learn more in the documentation.\nRemove props.url usage from page components\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis property was deprecated in Next.js 4 and has since shown a warning during development. With the introduction of getStaticProps / getServerSideProps these methods already disallowed the usage of props.url. In Next.js 11, it was removed completely.\nYou can learn more in the documentation.\nRemove unsized property on next/image\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe unsized property on next/image was deprecated in Next.js 10.0.1. You can use layout=\"fill\" instead. In Next.js 11 unsized was removed.\nRemove modules property on next/dynamic\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe modules and render option for next/dynamic were deprecated in Next.js 9.5. This was done in order to make the next/dynamic API closer to React.lazy. In Next.js 11, the modules and render options were removed.\nThis option hasn't been mentioned in the documentation since Next.js 8 so it's less likely that your application is using it.\nIf your application does use modules and render you can refer to the documentation.\nRemove Head.rewind\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nHead.rewind has been a no-op since Next.js 9.5, in Next.js 11 it was removed. You can safely remove your usage of Head.rewind.\nMoment.js locales excluded by default\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMoment.js includes translations for a lot of locales by default. Next.js now automatically excludes these locales by default to optimize bundle size for applications using Moment.js.\nTo load a specific locale use this snippet:\nimport moment from 'moment'\nimport 'moment/locale/ja'\n \nmoment.locale('ja')\nYou can opt-out of this new default by adding excludeDefaultMomentLocales: false to next.config.js if you do not want the new behavior, do note it's highly recommended to not disable this new optimization as it significantly reduces the size of Moment.js.\nUpdate usage of router.events\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIn case you're accessing router.events during rendering, in Next.js 11 router.events is no longer provided during pre-rendering. Ensure you're accessing router.events in useEffect:\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const handleRouteChange = (url, { shallow }) => {\n    console.log(\n      `App is changing to ${url} ${\n        shallow ? 'with' : 'without'\n      } shallow routing`\n    )\n  }\n \n  router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n \n  // If the component is unmounted, unsubscribe\n  // from the event with the `off` method:\n  return () => {\n    router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n  }\n}, [router])\nIf your application uses router.router.events which was an internal property that was not public please make sure to use router.events as well.\nReact 16 to 17\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nReact 17 introduced a new JSX Transform that brings a long-time Next.js feature to the wider React ecosystem: Not having to import React from 'react' when using JSX. When using React 17 Next.js will automatically use the new transform. This transform does not make the React variable global, which was an unintended side-effect of the previous Next.js implementation. A codemod is available to automatically fix cases where you accidentally used React without importing it.\nMost applications already use the latest version of React, with Next.js 11 the minimum React version has been updated to 17.0.2.\nTo upgrade you can run the following command:\nnpm install react@latest react-dom@latest\n\nOr using yarn:\nyarn add react@latest react-dom@latest\n"},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_upgrading_version-12.txt","text":"Version 12To upgrade to version 12, run the following command:\nTerminalnpm i next@12 react@17 react-dom@17 eslint-config-next@12\nTerminalyarn add next@12 react@17 react-dom@17 eslint-config-next@12\nTerminalpnpm up next@12 react@17 react-dom@17 eslint-config-next@12\nTerminalbun add next@12 react@17 react-dom@17 eslint-config-next@12\n\nGood to know: If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade @types/react and @types/react-dom to their corresponding versions.\n\nUpgrading to 12.2\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMiddleware - If you were using Middleware prior to 12.2, please see the upgrade guide for more information.\nUpgrading to 12.0\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nMinimum Node.js Version - The minimum Node.js version has been bumped from 12.0.0 to 12.22.0 which is the first version of Node.js with native ES Modules support.\nMinimum React Version - The minimum required React version is 17.0.2.

This new compiler is up to 17x faster than Babel when compiling individual files and up to 5x faster Fast Refresh.\nNext.js provides full backward compatibility with applications that have custom Babel configuration. All transformations that Next.js handles by default like styled-jsx and tree-shaking of getStaticProps / getStaticPaths / getServerSideProps have been ported to Rust.\nWhen an application has a custom Babel configuration, Next.js will automatically opt-out of using SWC for compiling JavaScript/Typescript and will fall back to using Babel in the same way that it was used in Next.js 11.\nMany of the integrations with external libraries that currently require custom Babel transformations will be ported to Rust-based SWC transforms in the near future. These include but are not limited to:\n\nStyled Components\nEmotion\nRelay\n\nIn order to prioritize transforms that will help you adopt SWC, please provide your .babelrc on this feedback thread.\nSWC replacing Terser for minification\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nYou can opt-in to replacing Terser with SWC for minifying JavaScript up to 7x faster using a flag in next.config.js:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  swcMinify: true,\n}\nMinification using SWC is an opt-in flag to ensure it can be tested against more real-world Next.js applications before it becomes the default in Next.js 12.1. If you have feedback about minification, please leave it on this feedback thread.\nImprovements to styled-jsx CSS parsing\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nOn top of the Rust-based compiler we've implemented a new CSS parser based on the one used for the styled-jsx Babel transform. This new parser has improved handling of CSS and now errors when invalid CSS is used that would previously slip through and cause unexpected behavior.\nBecause of this change invalid CSS will throw an error during development and next build. This change only affects styled-jsx usage.\nnext/image changed wrapping element\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nnext/image now renders the <img> inside a <span> instead of <div>.\nIf your application has specific CSS targeting span such as .container span, upgrading to Next.js 12 might incorrectly match the wrapping element inside the <Image> component. You can avoid this by restricting the selector to a specific class such as .container span.item and updating the relevant component with that className, such as <span className=\"item\" />.\nIf your application has specific CSS targeting the next/image <div> tag, for example .container div, it may not match anymore. You can update the selector .container span, or preferably, add a new <div className=\"wrapper\"> wrapping the <Image> component and target that instead such as .container .wrapper.\nThe className prop is unchanged and will still be passed to the underlying <img> element.\nSee the documentation for more info.\nHMR connection now uses a WebSocket\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPreviously, Next.js used a server-sent events connection to receive HMR events. Next.js 12 now uses a WebSocket connection.\nIn some cases when proxying requests to the Next.js dev server, you will need to ensure the upgrade request is handled correctly. For example, in nginx you would need to add the following configuration:\nlocation /_next/webpack-hmr {\n    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr;\n    proxy_http_version 1.1;\n    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n    proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n}\nIf you are using Apache (2.x), you can add the following configuration to enable web sockets to the server. Review the port, host name and server names.\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n # ServerName yourwebsite.local\n ServerName \"${WEBSITE_SERVER_NAME}\"\n ProxyPass / http://localhost:3000/\n ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3000/\n # Next.js 12 uses websocket\n <Location /_next/webpack-hmr>\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} transport=websocket [NC]\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]\n    RewriteRule /(.*) ws://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr/$1 [P,L]\n    ProxyPass ws://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr retry=0 timeout=30\n    ProxyPassReverse ws://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr\n </Location>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nFor custom servers, such as express, you may need to use app.all to ensure the request is passed correctly, for example:\napp.all('/_next/webpack-hmr', (req, res) => {\n  nextjsRequestHandler(req, res)\n})\nWebpack 4 support has been removed\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you are already using webpack 5 you can skip this section.\nNext.js has adopted webpack 5 as the default for compilation in Next.js 11. As communicated in the webpack 5 upgrading documentation Next.js 12 removes support for webpack 4.\nIf your application is still using webpack 4 using the opt-out flag, you will now see an error linking to the webpack 5 upgrading documentation.\ntarget option deprecated\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you do not have target in next.config.js you can skip this section.\nThe target option has been deprecated in favor of built-in support for tracing what dependencies are needed to run a page.\nDuring next build, Next.js will automatically trace each page and its dependencies to determine all of the files that are needed for deploying a production version of your application.\nIf you are currently using the target option set to serverless, please read the documentation on how to leverage the new output."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_upgrading_version-13.txt","text":"Version 13Upgrading from 12 to 13\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo update to Next.js version 13, run the following command using your preferred package manager:\nTerminalnpm i next@13 react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@13\nTerminalyarn add next@13 react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@13\nTerminalpnpm i next@13 react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@13\nTerminalbun add next@13 react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@13\n\nGood to know: If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade @types/react and @types/react-dom to their latest versions.\n\nv13 Summary\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nThe Supported Browsers have been changed to drop Internet Explorer and target modern browsers.\nThe minimum Node.js version has been bumped from 12.22.0 to 16.14.0, since 12.x and 14.x have reached end-of-life.\nThe minimum React version has been bumped from 17.0.2 to 18.2.0.\nThe swcMinify configuration property was changed from false to true.

A codemod is available to automatically upgrade your code.\nThe target configuration property has been removed and superseded by Output File Tracing.\n\nMigrating shared features\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js 13 introduces a new app directory with new features and conventions. However, upgrading to Next.js 13 does not require using the new app directory.\nYou can continue using pages with new features that work in both directories, such as the updated Image component, Link component, Script component, and Font optimization.\n<Image/> Component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js 12 introduced many improvements to the Image Component with a temporary import: next/future/image. These improvements included less client-side JavaScript, easier ways to extend and style images, better accessibility, and native browser lazy loading.\nStarting in Next.js 13, this new behavior is now the default for next/image.\nThere are two codemods to help you migrate to the new Image Component:\n\nnext-image-to-legacy-image: This codemod will safely and automatically rename next/image imports to next/legacy/image to maintain the same behavior as Next.js 12. We recommend running this codemod to quickly update to Next.js 13 automatically.\nnext-image-experimental: After running the previous codemod, you can optionally run this experimental codemod to upgrade next/legacy/image to the new next/image, which will remove unused props and add inline styles. Please note this codemod is experimental and only covers static usage (such as <Image src={img} layout=\"responsive\" />) but not dynamic usage (such as <Image {...props} />).\n\nAlternatively, you can manually update by following the migration guide and also see the legacy comparison.\n<Link> Component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe <Link> Component no longer requires manually adding an <a> tag as a child. This behavior was added as an experimental option in version 12.2 and is now the default. In Next.js 13, <Link> always renders <a> and allows you to forward props to the underlying tag.\nFor example:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \n// Next.js 12: `<a>` has to be nested otherwise it's excluded\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a>About</a>\n</Link>\n \n// Next.js 13: `<Link>` always renders `<a>` under the hood\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  About\n</Link>\nTo upgrade your links to Next.js 13, you can use the new-link codemod.\n<Script> Component\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe behavior of next/script has been updated to support both pages and app. If incrementally adopting app, read the upgrade guide.\nFont Optimization\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPreviously, Next.js helped you optimize fonts by inlining font CSS. Version 13 introduces the new next/font module which gives you the ability to customize your font loading experience while still ensuring great performance and privacy.\nSee Optimizing Fonts to learn how to use next/font."},{"filePath":"https:__nextjs.org_docs_pages_building-your-application_upgrading_version-14.txt","text":"Version 14\nUpgrading from 13 to 14\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nTo update to Next.js version 14, run the following command using your preferred package manager:\nTerminalnpm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest\nTerminalyarn add next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest\nTerminalpnpm up next react react-dom eslint-config-next --latest\nTerminalbun add next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest\n\nGood to know: If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade @types/react and @types/react-dom to their latest versions.\n\nv14 Summary\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nThe minimum Node.js version has been bumped from 16.14 to 18.17, since 16.x has reached end-of-life.\nThe next export command has been removed in favor of output: 'export' config.

You can still customize this behavior by setting the loading property:\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading = dynamic(\n  () => import('../components/hello2'),\n  {\n    loading: () => <p>Loading</p>,\n  }\n)\nwithAmp has been removed in favor of an exported configuration object\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nNext.js now has the concept of page-level configuration, so the withAmp higher-order component has been removed for consistency.\nThis change can be automatically migrated by running the following commands in the root of your Next.js project:\nTerminalcurl -L https://github.com/vercel/next-codemod/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip=2 next-codemod-master/transforms/withamp-to-config.js npx jscodeshift -t ./withamp-to-config.js pages/**/*.js\nTo perform this migration by hand, or view what the codemod will produce, see below:\nBefore\nimport { withAmp } from 'next/amp'\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return <h1>My AMP Page</h1>\n}\n \nexport default withAmp(Home)\n// or\nexport default withAmp(Home, { hybrid: true })\nAfter\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <h1>My AMP Page</h1>\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  amp: true,\n  // or\n  amp: 'hybrid',\n}\nnext export no longer exports pages as index.html\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPreviously, exporting pages/about.js would result in out/about/index.html. This behavior has been changed to result in out/about.html.\nYou can revert to the previous behavior by creating a next.config.js with the following content:\nnext.config.jsmodule.exports = {\n  trailingSlash: true,\n}\npages/api/ is treated differently\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nPages in pages/api/ are now considered API Routes.\nPages in this directory will no longer contain a client-side bundle.\nDeprecated Features\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nnext/dynamic has deprecated loading multiple modules at once\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe ability to load multiple modules at once has been deprecated in next/dynamic to be closer to React's implementation (React.lazy and Suspense).\nUpdating code that relies on this behavior is relatively straightforward! We've provided an example of a before/after to help you migrate your application:\nBefore\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst HelloBundle = dynamic({\n  modules: () => {\n    const components = {\n      Hello1: () => import('../components/hello1').then((m) => m.default),\n      Hello2: () => import('../components/hello2').then((m) => m.default),\n    }\n \n    return components\n  },\n  render: (props, { Hello1, Hello2 }) => (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{props.title}</h1>\n      <Hello1 />\n      <Hello2 />\n    </div>\n  ),\n})\n \nfunction DynamicBundle() {\n  return <HelloBundle title=\"Dynamic Bundle\" />\n}\n \nexport default DynamicBundle\nAfter\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst Hello1 = dynamic(() => import('../components/hello1'))\nconst Hello2 = dynamic(() => import('../components/hello2'))\n \nfunction HelloBundle({ title }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      <Hello1 />\n      <Hello2 />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nfunction DynamicBundle() {\n  return <HelloBundle title=\"Dynamic Bundle\" />\n}\n \nexport default DynamicBundle"}]
